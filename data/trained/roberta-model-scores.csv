I was in here to pick dessert for date night as a thank you to the beau for cooking me dinner. I picked up the Mon Chéri Verrine which was packaged in a cute glass jar with chocolate espresso crémeux, hazelnut financier, cherry gelée, cocoa nibs, and candied hazelnuts.

I also got a little greedy and also decided to pick up the Mont Blanc Macaron Gateau cause who can say no to a macaron cookie top and bottom filled with chestnut cognac cream, chantilly and toasted almond buttercream?

Walking into the restaurant I was impressed with the clean, modern decor. Despite the upscale feel to the restaurant, their dishes are surprisingly affordable. The trendy staff were also kind and helpful which made the experience comfortable. They were able to accommodate a group of 9 of us including a baby, although space was a bit tight. At the end of the night they even split the bill for us which was a pretty complicated matter.

Aesthetically, everything was great and wine bottles were half off that night!!! Korean blackberry wine is SOOO DELICIOUS, and the flavour is fruity but not too similar to fresh blackberries and not overly sweet like other port wines. I could drink it up like juice. 

The food presentation was nice, and I really enjoyed the Kalbi bites. I also tried the beef tataki, rice pops (both spicy and honey garlic), kimchi fried rice, osaka okonomiyaki, and bulgogi stew. Although flavour-wise everything was pretty good, having experienced a lot of Korean cuisine, I think things could have been better. For example, the beef tataki was on the chewier side and the honey garlic rice pops, although delicious in flavour, was a tad too salty for me. Some of the other dishes could ramp up flavour intensity a bit. They are a new restaurant so I'm sure given time things will become more refined. However, all said and done, the food is still pretty tasty. Their desserts topped up the evening nicely. The Snowbowl (literally tastes like yummy flavoured snow in a bowl) and Hotteok (yummy Korean crispy pancake topped with whipping cream) were unique experiences for me!",4

I walked into the restaurant and the guy at the door told me to walk back down the sidewalk and enter in the other door on the left side of the patio.

I went to pickup my takeout order which was right at the counter to where I originally walked in 2 minutes before... smh. Anyways!! I ordered the beef stroganoff which was pretty delicious. I would recommend eating that dish in-house as the panko egg gets soggy when taken to-go. There was a lot of food in this dish, the sauce was tasty and they are generous on the beef.

Located right beside a Domo gas station and a random Chinese restaurant, New Dragon Palace Seafood Restaurant, I've been in this plaza so many times but never thought to try their food until my parents went one night and said they enjoyed it. With so many good Thai places in town (heck, Ban Thai and Thai Flavours are two nearby west end eateries), Thai Basil has some tough competition to live up to.

L and I decided to check out TB on a Wednesday night before we hit up the Craig Ferguson show. I was pleasantly surprised to see the interior is nicely decorated and has a very inviting, serene atmosphere. The place was quite busy with most of the tables filled with diners. We always over order but somehow never seem to have any leftovers. The family running the restaurant is friendly and service is good.

- Chicken satay (#4) ($10.00) - chicken marinated in Thai style peanut sauce, grilled and served with peanut sauce and cucumber. You get four pieces of satay. The chicken was a tad on the dry side and I wasn't very wowed by their peanut sauce. 
- Tom yum (#11) ($7.00) - Thai style hot and sour soup with mushrooms, galangal, You can choose chicken or shrimp ($1.00 extra) in a Thai style hot and sour soup with mushrooms and galangal. The soup smelled heavenly when it arrived but taste wise, it was lacking depth. You know that sweet, spicy, heat that comes at you in waves? That was missing from their tom yum. Decent but lacking punch.

- Green curry tofu (#45) ($14.00) - Thai green curry tofu, sweet peas, carrots, broccoli, green and red peppers and basil leaves. We wanted some extra vegetables so we ordered the green curry with tofu. The dish smelled delicious and aromatic but again, after having a taste, it was disappointing. We both couldn't taste any curry but a coconut, watered down flavour became prominent. 
- Pad woon sen (#57) ($14.00) - stir-fried glass noodles with pork, egg, tomato, onions, red and green peppers, green onions. This was the best dish that we ordered that night. I'm a sucker or glass noodles and these had a great chewy texture with a nicely balance of flavour.

- 2x Steamed jasmine rice ($4.00) - we were told a normal order is one small bowl so we ordered two to share. Not much to say about their jasmine rice as it was pretty standard stuff.
- Deep fried banana with ice cream ($6.00) - they have three desserts to choose from (stick rice with mango was another option, forget the third) but my buddy L is in love with anything banana related. For $6.00, the portion sure is tiny. 4 dinky sized pieces of deep fried bananas and your choice of vanilla or mango ice cream. I had a bite, which was tasty, but for that price, I wasn't impressed.

Thai Basil was pretty much what I was expecting. With more misses than hits with their dishes, I won't be clambering back anytime soon. Our meal came to almost $60 before tip and for that price, I can get excellent Thai elsewhere. Why settle for mediocre? Sorry Thai Basil but I'll be getting my fix elsewhere.",3

Lots of food options. We ordered vegan ginger beer, vegan Mongolian chicken and our usual vegan chicken curry. Our niece is visiting from USA and she wanted to try vegan food so we ordered Padmanadi platter. Best part molten chocolate cake & cheese cake for dessert. Desert to die for.
Food very delicious. High end dining.  Washrooms available. Parking available in front or side of the building.

Well, I wasn't the only one -- the line up was long, but at least it was much shorter than the one at Second Cup (I suspect those at Second Cup weren't aware of L'espresso across the street).

It's a quaint and colorful Mediterannean cafe just off Churchill Square. There's a small fireplace on one side, with bright colored couches around it, and plenty of small tables throughout the rest of the space. A small flat-screen tv is perched near the ceiling by the windows.

I can only vouch for the hot chocolate, but it was yummy -- not too sweet, and you can taste they made it with milk, it's not the watered down stuff. They also sell baked treats, soups and panini sandwiches, and gyros wraps. The hot drinks were most popular last night, as everyone wanted to stay warm.

It's decent. I really like the sauce which goes well with all the fried stuff, especially Tonkatsu. The chicken itself is nothing special, but for us, the portion is enough to be shared among 2 people. The cuts are pretty big. If you're a big eater then you probably will end up finishing the whole basket.

We also ordered the Nara Special Tonkatsu that comes with both sirloin and tenderloin Tonkatsu + their special sauce (different from the sauce on the chicken). The portion is pretty big, and I think it meant to be shared or for a big eater. I did finish the whole thing by myself tho so it's not like it's impossible LOL

If you've read my last review about the Nara Pizza Tonkatsu (still dreaming about that cheese) you know how much I love their Tonkatsu. It's so soft inside and crispy on the outside. I finally figure out the secret of the crispness, they use real bread to make the crumbs which is surprising since I couldn't really taste bread. As for the special sauce, I know I won't like it once the staff mentioned that it was a mixture of garlic, soy sauce, apple, and BANANA! The banana flavour is way too strong for me. I could only taste banana. So I ordered the curry sauce on the side which complemented the Tonkatsu very well.

Honestly, I won't be able to choose between the curry sauce or the sweet & spicy sauce. I probably will always end up ordering both everytime. 

If you decide to come and try this place, definitely go for the Tonkatsu. Legit the best Tonkatsu I've ever eaten!",4

I probably will not return, as the prices are really expensive for what You order.

Most Asian restaurants are half the cost for main dishes, and the portions are similar, so not sure why their prices are pretty much 100% more than other Asian restaurants.

In conclusion, food is Good! Prices are a deterrent.",4

This place does not disappoint.

The decor is pretty quaint with hanging light bulbs and a nice combination of communal seats and individual tables. It's definitely a tiny space but it still has an inviting feel to it. 

Our gal came over and took our drink order while we checked out the menu. Lots of options beside the classic fish and chips, but that's not why I'm here. Honestly there's probably 25% of the menu that no one would ever order but fine. The fish of the day was something called an Orange Gruffy, or something to that effect, had to try that, while the gf got the traditional haddock and chips.

After a few, a couple of amazing baskets show up with huge pieces of fish and a mountain of fries. The batter they use really stood out to me, completely different than I've ever had. Extremely light and not at all greasy. If I was nursing a worse hang over I may have been disappointed but it was just about perfect. I probably wouldn't get the Orange Fluffy or whatever again, not that it was bad, just a little mild for my taste. The haddock my lady got was perfect. Nice meaty texture and perfectly fried. Both fish were incredibly fresh and the place smell like the ocean.

The star of the show, besides some pretty amazing fish, were the fries. They're blanch double fried to perfection. And you get a ton of them.

I will be returning sooner than later to this another new downtown gem. 

Cheers

I cannot say which cheese is the best as everybody's tastes differ, but I do love all kinds of cheese from Switzerland and Spain, as well as those stinky French cheeses, and when it comes to selection of those- Paddy's delivers. You can request to try the cheese before you buy it, and the sales people are happy to let you do so. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly.

Their curried 'chicken' was very tasty and very deceptive...  That chicken was tofu and as a self-described lover of all things meat, I was shocked at both the great taste and great texture of this faux-chicken. 

I had to find out more and decided to try out their restaurant on 101 St between 108 & 107 Ave.  While not the best part of town, the trip was worth it.  The interior of the restaurant was bright and colorfully decorated with an electic mix of Asian inspiration juxtaposed with contemporary photos of staff happily smiling around the entire restaurant.

The food was nothing short of great.  The ginger 'beef', the curried 'chicken', the spicy eggplant, the fried Indonesian noodles, the count rice...  The list goes on.  All were incredibly tasty and all stood on their own as great eats.  

If you haven't tried Padmanadi, don't be shy.  If you fear that wet cardboard texture of tofu, don't be scared.  Padmanadi has become one of my family's favorite places to eat in Edmonton.  They do a great job serving up great food period.  You won't know the difference!",5

Some things don't change, the cleaning the table with a cloth after pouring the leftover tea on the table, and looking and wiping your tea cup and bowl with a napkin before using. 

The menu has a lot of dishes from wonton and noodle soup, rice, and entrees to go with the rice. For 4 of us, we ordered 3 entrees and that was more than enough food. I had the beef brisket chow mein and it was a large plate filled with noodles, beef, and veggies. For just over $10, it was more than a meal for one. Service primarily consisted of bringing menus, taking order, and brining food and drinks. I think we helped ourselves to the take out containers close to our booth table. 

We paid at the cashier area and made our way out with our leftovers. Walking to the car, there were a number of people that would have happily taken out leftovers if we didn't want them.

The quality of the sushi, in a word, was subpar. I could not pick out distinct tastes in the sushi.

The staff were helpful but a little confused. It took them five minutes to find a menu that was not an AYCE menu. 
 
As for non-fish items, the gyoza were very dry and tiny for the price. I would not recommend ordering them. The mango sushi were very interesting: the tempura bits made for a very unique texture. I loved them and everyone else at my table did too.

Also, I would not recommend this restaurant for business lunches or dates. It's far too run down. 

Unfortunately, the mango sushi is not enough to convince me to come back here. Skip this place.",2

We both reminisced about our time in the Syrian desert about this time last year we sat in the car and thanked the auto-Gods for heated seats. Our conversation went from the heat we wish we had, to the Palmyran ruins, to the Bedouin food, to ""Oh hey! That place has Shisha in the window!"" and so we decided to wander into The Sultan Palace. 

The Palace is located across from Save On Foods in the bottom of a very large condo/apartment complex. The restaurant is simply decorated with pictures of Lebanon on the walls and fake vines with grapes hanging from the ceilings. The menu is small but well priced and offers a good sampling of Middle Eastern Cuisine. Heath and I decided on a pot of tea (about 6$), Dolma (about 6$) and a chicken panini for him (about 7$) and a beef shwarma for me (about $7). 

The Dolma arrived quickly. There was four on the plate and we quickly devoured them. They were delicious with hints of lemon and dill. The shwarma and panini arrived quickly afterwards wrapped in foil. The shwarma was perfect! The tenderloin was cooked to perfection, the tahini was not overpowering and the bread was fresh. I had a bite of Heath's chicken panini which was also nicely done and complimented with a strong garlic sauce.   As we ate we enjoyed the pictures of Lebanon up everywhere and the lack of English around us.  It was like being transported back to little restaurants we loved in the Middle East.  

We finished our food feeling comfortable and not too full. We decided no shisha for us today as we didn't have the time to properly enjoy it, although had we gone for some, they had a wide range of flavors for 12$ and 7$ refills. We will be back for shisha and food in the future!",4

Best and most authentic Mexican food in Edmonton in my opinion.  I love Tres Carnales and El Cortez but you'll never find the tremendous variety of Mexican fare there that you will at HUMA. Neither will you find the cheap mess of runny refried beans and fatty oil slicks of shredded cheddar that have traditionally been represented as Mexican fare in Canada.

Message me with recommendations if you know of a better place! Homemade queso? Beautiful desserts? Octopus dishes? 2 kinds of ceviche? Molé dishes including a TO DIE FOR spiced chocolate mousse?? HUMA sets the bar pretty high!

The menu selection is huge, in a ""man I need to eat here more often"" kind of way.
I've brought many different friends here and none have left disappointed with their meals. The service does leave something to be desired; we've had a couple different young male servers who were quite hapless and needed directing by the kitchen mistress to do basics like seat customers. One had trouble with english and made several errors.  Another didn't know the names of the dishes and couldn't pronounce them either.

I agree with other reviewers that the prices are a bit steep ($15 for a thin fried cheese dosa?) but I can forgive that for handmade homestyle food. The portions are very generous. A large meal for 2 people should run you about $25 per person including two beer, one appy, two mains and a dessert. There's a reason the desserts are designed to go - you'll be too stuffed! Don't let the ""lighter fare"" section of the menu fool you, the food is heavy.

Dishes I don't recommend:
- Enmoladas : disappointingly bland, could use more spice in the molé. Also the chicken inside was totally plain, dulling the dish further.
- Empanadas del Mar: way too much heavy pastry and too little filling for the price

Darn near everything else has been really tasty. I also love the decor, and the new easy to navigate menus.

You can also get 5pcs of chicken and a beer for around $12. The best value pick for me was the 5pc set ($11.40) that comes with 5 pcs of chicken, half portion of salad, your choice of fries or a corn fritter, and a can of pop/bottled water. My boyfriend and I tried the garlic soy and the GP Cheese with grated grano padano with kale caesar, mac and cheese pesto and fries. 

The garlic soy chicken was good, not too salty and was flavourful. The GP cheese was VERY cheesy and heavy.. I still enjoyed it but my bf found it to be too heavy. I think its best to order the cheese flavour with another flavour to break up the heaviness a little bit. The Kale caesar was good and the mac and cheese is good if you love your pesto. The fries were subpar in my opinion, too thick so ended up tasting kinda mushy.

The server/girl who took are order was nice but she seemed to have trouble doing the simplest things. She also didn't put in my mom's order so she had to wait for her meal while the rest of us ate (don't worry, I split my seafood platter with her while we waited for her dish to arrive).

Anyways, we each ordered a dish:

- Seafood platter ($14.95) - comes with two shrimp, two scallops (these were awesome), one deep fried oyster (eh) and one cod (good) along with fries
- Soup of the day ($5.95) - had bits of seafood in it, nothing special.
- Fish and chips ($10.95) - comes with one piece of halibut fish.
- 2x Pasta special ($11.95)  - fettucini with a tomato sauce and shrimp
- 2x Grilled salmon ($16.95) - our grandparents liked it. Salmon was tender but the vegetables were too hard so they had to send it back to the chef.

Overall, I wasn't that impressed with the food but I guess I hadn't had my expectations too high so that helped to keep things in perspective.

Yuck.  But the worst part....the graham crust.  It was like sawdust. Barely any fresh flavor, tasted like old stale, fine graham crumbs mixed with water and sugar and pressed and dried out....did not even taste baked.

Being an avid user of Yelp and seeing the exceptional reviews, I was excited to visit Tzin with a group of girlfriends for an evening of wine and tapas. Long story short, one of the ladies had not been feeling well and so we pushed back our reservation and in the end unfortunately had to cancel at late notice as she just was not feeling up to attend. 

I believe it is common courtesy to call and cancel a reservation regardless of how close to the reservation time it is. Upon calling I spoke with a male host. After apologizing for canceling the reservation so late the host proceeded to scold me for doing so. As a first time customer, this has cemented a terrible impression of what I'm sure is a very nice establishment. I understand that a table had been held for our small party, but I don't believe that this gives staff the grounds to treat customers with disrespect. 

With so many new wine and tapas bars opening in Edmonton that have good food and wine lists, customer service will become an integral part of choosing where to spend ones money. Unfortunately for our party, Tzin will not be our wine bar of choice until their customer service is addressed.",1

The space is quite different from Corso and Bricco, as Uccellino is lit by natural light through a big front window and is more spacious with high ceilings and larger square footage. The dining space features neutral tones and minimalist decor, giving it a great modern, casual vibe from the moment you walk in. 

Given the larger space, Uccellino can seat roughly 70-80 guests, and the top floor hosts a space for private dining. Reservations at Corso 32 are difficult to score without advance booking, and Bar Bricco can have long wait times, so you'll be glad to hear that half the seats at Uccellino will remain unreserved for every dinner service. How great is that?

Uccellino's menu features traditional dishes you would find in Central and Southern Italy. The menu is separated by multiple courses, in true Italian style: Fritti & Crostini, Antipasti, Primi, Secondi, Formaggi & Dolci. Among the multiple dishes there truly is something for everyone as the menu features some vegan and vegetarian options too. I didn't have trouble finding something I liked - my issue was trying to narrow it down to a few dishes as I was tempted by the whole menu! 

After ordering, every table gets a dish of olives for snacking. I'm not a huge fan of olives, but these green olives were brined beautifully with hints of orange and caraway, which complemented the buttery flesh and mild flavour.

First to our table was the Potato Croquette ($10/5) made with parmigiano, lemon and nutmeg. The golden brown exterior had a nice crunch, like that of the delicious arancini at Corso 32. Breaking into the middle revealed a velvety mix of potato and fragrant parmigiano - a flavourful combination that makes these croquettes little umami bombs. 

Our next plate was the rustic Chicken Liver & Balsamico Crostini ($11/3), where the pate was spread across three large, lightly toasted crostini. The chicken liver itself was smooth and well seasoned, and I enjoyed the contrasting sweetness from the balsamic drizzled overtop. 

As we waited for our main courses to arrive, the kitchen sent out a plate of beautiful Gnudi Verde ($18). The six spinach and ricotta dumplings took up the flavour of the fragrant sage butter they were cooked in, and they were delicious. The light dusting of parmigiano was the perfect finishing touch to give them a bit more flavour without overpowering the delicate gnudi. 

Unlike Corso 32 & Bar Bricco, Uccellino is utilizing dry pasta from Italy, so we had to try them out for our mains. The dry pasta from Pasta Setaro and La Pasta dei Martellii is exclusive to the restaurant in Edmonton, and diners can actually purchase packages to take home and cook.

For myself I couldn't pass up the Mezza Maniche Cacio e Pepe ($17) with Sardinian pecorino and fresh ground black pepper. Although simple, cacio e pepe is one of my favourite ways to eat pasta, and this dish hit the spot. The pasta was al dente with a great bite, the pepper carried a bit of heat, and the sauce was rich and clung to every bit of pasta. 

We also ordered the Maccheroni ($19) cooked in a pigs head and prosciutto ragu bianco, and finished with a dusting of parmigiano. The dish had a nice proportion of meat to it and it was another great pasta with balanced flavours. 

The Dolci portion of the menu offers four desserts, but I was particularly drawn to the Amedei Chocolate Budino. A budino is a dessert similar to a custard or pudding, so I was surprised to see the budino presented in the form of a slice of cake. On the first bite I fell in love - the texture was similar to that of a dense mousse, and it just melts in your mouth. The dark chocolate had just the right hint of sweetness, and the dallop of creme fraiche on the plate had a bit of tang that complemented the chocolate incredibly well. If you enjoy the Amedei chocolate truffles at Bar Bricco, you'll love this dessert. I thought that Corso 32's Chocolate Torta and Panna Cotta were my top desserts in Edmonton, but this budino is making me reconsider! 

Our visit was on the third opening day at Uccellino and we had a fantastic meal with exceptional service. I love that the restaurant is more casual compared to Chef Costa's other establishments, and the menu has a bit of a lower price point as well. The menu is fairly extensive and may possibly change from time to time due to seasonality, but there will be something for everyone. The bigger space will allow for more patrons and hopefully shorter wait times, which I'm sure many Edmontonians will be happy about. And with half the seats unreserved, that will allow for more spontaneous visits to the restaurant. The doors are now open, so make sure to stop by for dinner service from 5-11 PM Wednesday through Sunday!",5

Arrived at 7:45pm and security promptly asked for ID, despite minors being welcome until 9:00pm. Security was very persistent about the minor in our party being out before 9:00pm, as this is their policy this is understandable. Service was very slow after we had sat down, although it was a Friday night and we were a part of a large group. Unfortunately once we had been served, the food was very average and disappointing. The $59 smokehouse platter contained very dry over-cooked brisket and over seasoned ribs. This was an opinion shared across our table between those who had ordered it. For this price we were extremely let down. None of the food that was ordered stood out above any other typical bar food, which would have been much cheaper. 

Despite the dissatisfying menu the extensive beer selection was impressive and the cocktails we had were enjoyable and worth the price. Overall, the atmosphere, drinks, and decor was pleasant. 

As it approached 9:00pm the same security guard confronted our minor, who was obviously dependent on us, and rudely told her that she had to leave. While this is their policy we felt it was inappropriate and offensive for him to direct the message to her, as opposed to her guardians. Although this does not reflect the overall security staff, we feel this employee lacked professionalism and was inconsiderate of the customer.

We are unlikely to return to MKT in the future due to the poor service and unenjoyable food.",2

My hopes were high to taste a decent meal and order a tonkatsu udon.
However, when I saw my dish laid on the table I was instantly disappointed. I will be 100 per cent honest; the batter of tonkatsu was horrible, it was flat ! not flaky(nothing like the famous japanese panko style), dark from frying them in an overused oil, the stalk used to make the soup tasted like it was made with powdered stalks (I know this because I am asian and I've tasted asian style stalks made by my mom hundreds of times), the noodles were over cooked. Although as I was eating I promised to myself I will never come to this place again, I was terribly hungry I galloped the whole dish. Also when I went to the counter to pay I was glad I didn't order a bento or any sort that contains nigiri sushi because 1) Just by the glimpse I could tell the fish weren't fresh at all 2) the chef's hair wasn't even tightly tied back 3) she took forever forming the sushi in her warm hand, almost cooking the fish.

Once we got to the front the staff were pleasant and set us up right away. Not going to lie, I was super pumped about the adorable pink shoes that I was given!! Shoe rentals are only $3. 

The place was fairly clean and the custodian came around fairly often to pick up any garbage, bottles, etc. It looks like they have a quite extensive menu. We just had a few wobbly pops and they had the selection that we were looking for. 

We ended up bowling three games and had a ton of fun - we had no problems with the lanes, pins or balls, which was nice! Games were just under $6 per person and the three games took us just under 2 hours. So that's a fair price per hour entertainment in my books. 

We hadn't been to Ed's in over 3 years. The last time were there we actually rented out the party room and two lanes and had our gift opening there the day after our wedding. And that was a blast!",4

Left with two ginger cookies, brioche pepin and an almond croissant. The quality of their baked goods is nice. The croissants are flakey - like really flakey (learn from me and don't eat it in the car)! The cookies are filled with real ginger and are quite spicy but still sweet. 

The service and flow of the counter service left something to be desired. It was well staffed for a Sunday afternoon with three staff behind the bakery case, one refilling pastries and a few people at what I assume to be the pick up counter. The side of the pastry case where the macarons, quiche and cakes are had no one manning it and an awkward line formed in front so others couldn't really see. By the time you got to the bend in the counter, a staff member was asking what you wanted. Which was great but I didn't even get a chance to see what was available for cookies, tarts, croissants etc. I felt a little rushed to choose so just picked a few things that were in my line of sight. When I got to the counter the young man helping me didn't ask if I would like anything else  - at that time I was kind of confused/annoyed and didn't want to stand in another line so I decided to skip the coffee order. 

I will be back to Duchess as it's an Edmonton institution and a great place to satisfy a sweet tooth. If I was a regular and knew exactly what to order then I may have enjoyed my experience a little more.",3

The first time was for a dinner with a friend I hadn't seen in a while, and we were so excited to be talking to each other I didn't pay much attention to anything else! It's great to have a restaurant like Browns in Windermere, we have been lacking in good dining options in the area since the development started.  The atmosphere is similar to earls or Moxies, with prices averaging around $18 for a meal.  The menu has a variety of food, with burgers, tacos, salads and assorted rice and pasta bowls.  On my first visit I got the chicken quesadillas, and they were outstanding; I ate half and took the other half home for a second meal the next day.  My second meal was the chicken Caesar salad, which was also delicious (moist chicken, fresh cheese and bacon), but could have been larger, it seemed like a small portion of lettuce for a dinner salad.  They have a menu of unique cocktails, and the one I tried (bellini slush with lemonade and blueberry vodka) was definitely a winner.  The only disappointment with the menu is their selection of beers.  For a restaurant with a bar in the middle, and a large patio with Oktoberfest signs hanging up, having only six beers on the menu really doesn't cut it.  I'm hoping they will expand the menu once the business has been more established.",4

I get that it was busy, but I feel like the people who work should be slightly more concerned about safety and when there's more then 10 people in the store the first priority should be making sure the people who's drinks are prepared are called to them so they don't have to risk their safety any longer.

Pan Chan is very sad since it consists of 3 store bought and stale dishes. Potato panchan is old and you can easily taste that it is from the store. Bibimbap comes  warm ( not hot enough to crisp the rice ) and the egg is pre cooked. It consists of 95% rice and then has mixed in stir fry frozen vegetables which were heated up. If you don't believe me please refer to the picture. Bulgogi is ok but pretty much a combination of sugar and dirty dish water. 

The prices are at least 1.5x other places. Sort of a rip off when compared to at least 10 other restaurants.  

Service is subpar, when i asked why the bibimbap is almost fully made of rice, they told me that i dont know what a real bibimbap is, which is highly offensive since i have been to probably 60 or 70 korean restaurants world ride. they just want to get rid you since they are so busy.

Afternoon Tea is only $20 and meant to be shared between 2 people. If you're really hungry, I guess you can have it all to yourself! This is super affordable compared to other high tea in the city. Unlike other places where you don't get to choose what to eat, there are options available here. There's a set menu with 3 categories, A+B+C, where you are able to choose your options from. Afternoon Tea at Reinette is more of a dessert because there's only one savoury food item to choose from.

The first category, A, allows you to choose 4 items from a list of 6. The items that my friend and I chose were mini apple cheesecake, mini Mont Blanc, mini Paris-Brest, and mini lemon meringue tart. The items we didn't try were try the mini rose green tea macaron because they ran out and the mini key lime tart.
- Mini lemon meringue tart: This had the perfect combination of zest and sweetness! The meringue was creamy while the crust wasn't too flaky. I'm a big lemon meringue lover so I really liked this item.
- Mini Mont-Blanc: This was a dessert with whipping cream covered with chestnut, on top of a macaron shell. My friend and I both thought this item just tasted like pure sugar and we didn't enjoy it.
- Mini apple cheesecake: Their cheesecake might be one of the best cheesecakes I've tried! I'm literally craving it right now as I right this. The cheesecake was very light and not thick or heavy like other ones. It's covered in apple slices that are braised in caramel and cinnamon. This is certainly a must-try!
- Mini Paris-Brest: This was a soft-choux pastry with almond cream on the inside, then topped with almond flakes. If you enjoy nutty pastries then you would like this!

For the second category, B, we were able to choose 3 items from a list of 5. We decided to try the mini Madeleine, a Financier, and an onion & cheese scone. The other items that we didn't choose were biscotti, mini Financier, and apple & raisin scone.
- Mini Madeleine: I think these were the cutest Madeleines I had ever eaten! There were 4 mini ones in the shape of rubber duckies! These tiny sponge cakes had hints of lemon zest throughout.
- Financier: The regular-sized Financier was shaped like a bear so I knew we had to get that instead of 2 small Financiers. I seriously love anything that is cute and animal-shaped! (Sometimes I think I'm actually 8 years old....) The Financier had raspberries and chocolate pieces throughout it. Nothing special but super cute!
- Onion & cheese scone: This was the only savoury item from the Afternoon Tea menu. I enjoyed it as the parmesan cheese wasn't overpowering. There were onion bits throughout that I didn't really taste.

The last category, C, was picking two drinks of your choice (1 for each person). For drink choices, there are tea lattes, teas, hot chocolate (white & dark), and coffee. Syphon coffee is offered for an additional cost.

I had earl grey tea while my friend had dark hot chocolate. She commented that the dark hot chocolate was too bitter and she couldn't finish it. I wanted to try the hot chocolate or tea latte except they only offered regular milk. I was told that if I wanted a different milk alternative I would have to bring my own. The worker suggested that there was a convenience store down the strip where I could buy soy milk and bring it over, which I found to be a bit odd??

The one thing I would have to comment on that threw my friend and I off during our visit was one of the workers. It didn't really bother us but we found his service to be a bit off. For example, we requested napkins since they weren't given to us or on tables. He commented that this was a ""self-serve place"", which we were not aware of since it was our first visit. I was also confused about whether the Afternoon Tea was for one person or two people. I thought it was for one person then when my friend and I paid, we were surprised by the total amount of our bill because it was less than we had expected. He informed us that it was for both of us then commented how he had already told me ""three times"" that Afternoon Tea was for two people. I believe that's just how his personality is but it can probably come off as the wrong way towards people. Other than that, the service was fine and didn't bother me aside from those comments.",4

I chose Istanbul thanks to Yelpers Mike & Mystery D!  Thanks guys!

This is my FAVORITE new restaurant!

It's located just North of the Yellowhead on 82nd street, in a strip mall.  Don't be put off from the outward appearances or somewhat hard to navigate parking lot - you are in for a TREAT!

It's a small little restaurant - I'd estimate that it has 15 tables and reservations are definitely recommended. 

We totally lucked out that we made reservations for 730pm on a Saturday because that's the exact time their Belly Dancer comes on Saturday evenings.  She was surprisingly good and really gave our night out a great ambiance.  She only stayed for half an hour, and our server, Lori, later told us that 730-800pm is her typical Saturday schedule.  

We started our meal with the fellow Yelpers recommended Istanbul Calamari - served in a ""creamy soy sauce"" - though, I would argue that it has more of a curry feel!  The calamari were steamed and tender - not fried!  The appetizer was served with a side of toasted pita bread which my Mom and I quickly used to sop up the remaining sauce that shall be here on known as ""liquid gold!""  I was seriously contemplating asking for a spoon so that I could slurp up the remaining liquid gold - it was as rich as a seafood bisque.  
 
Next, we shared the appetizer for two which consisted of 2 delicious chicken spring rolls, 2 cheese rolls (much like a spring roll - feta and seasoning wrapped like a spring roll, 2 dolmoths (spelling?) of rice wrapped in grape leaves, and house made tzatzki and hummus with pita bread.  It was a good sampling of their items - our favourites bing the chicken spring rolls and cheese rolls.  The tzatzkii was heavy with dill (not my personal favourite) and freshly made.  The hummus was average on this occasion.

And lastly, we shared a kebob plate - (they let you mix kebobs here if you don't want 2 of the same) 1 chicken & 1 beef.  My mother preferred the chicken and I preferred the beef - both were delicious and moist!  The entree came with a side of bulgar wheat (I think  it was tomato infused), a house salad that my Mom loved (unfortunately I didn't love it because of the red onions in the dressing), house hummus, and toasted pita bread.
 
I enjoyed Turkish tea with my meal - served in a little glass with one cube of sugar on the side (complimentary refills).  At my next visit, I plan on trying the Turkish coffee.  I've been told by a fellow Yelper that if you turn your cup upside down on your saucer, the owner will come and read your coffee grounds!  

The restaurant was warm, cozy, and decorated tastefully.  

I cannot wait to go back and try some new items on their menu!  The Istanbul special Calamari will be a staple for sure!

I've uploaded pics of all of our food and a few of the restaurant!  Including the sign as you walk in stating, ""As soon as your enter our doors, you are no longer a customer, you are our guest of honour.""  And it truly did feel like that!  The service we received from Lori was among the best I have ever had!  Cheers to Istanbul for a fabulous night out with my Mom, for phenomenal and fresh food, & for perfect customer service!

$$ 2 appetizers, 1 shared entree, and tea came to just under $45 $$",5

The truth is that this downtown branch of the Sypahy is simply spectacular... in a way that you might just want to keep it to yourself, but that's not very fair, is it?

Here, as down south, the Syphay produces some of the best Thai/Laotian and regional cuisine in the city.  Easily, as good or better than anything in Vancouver as well, and definitely the best Pad Thai in the city... nay, the province!  The major difference is that the southside location is like eating in a family rumpus room, but downtown has all the ambience and decor that you'd expect of a modern restaurant.

We started with salad roll (more Vietnamese) and delightful crunchy green papaya salad, which was delightfully cool yet hot with spice at the same time... Heaven!  Our main meal consisted of chicken penang curry (Malay infuenced), quintessentialy Thai beef matsa-man, and that  must order Pad Thai.

What makes this food great is that the spicing and seasoning is right on... absolutely authentic.  I'm native to the region and every bite is a nostalgic mouthful of home.  You can taste the sour notes, the bright notes, pungent curry, smoky nuttieness, creamy coconut; it's all there!  You can even ask them to make it like home for the heat, but if you're not up to crying (tears of JOY) through your meal, I recommend ""medium"" which provided plenty of kick for my fellow diners and enough zing for me to be happy.  Generous portions of streamed and coconut rice help dampen the fires.

I can't recommend the Syphay (at either location) enough, and if you go... order the Pad Thai in any of the myriad of varieties that they offer.  You will NOT be disappointed.  Service was friendly, informed and prompt during a fairly busy evening.",5

Current pricing is $29 for lunch and $39 or $43 (upcharge for better cut of beef) for dinners and all day on weekends. This includes 8 oz of protein you grill on the stone, plus unlimited sushi, sashimi and a variety of hot food. Their current promotion is unlimited protein that you can mix and match with a beverage purchase ($3 pop counts). For the smaller appetite, you can also order a la carte for very reasonable prices or set combos.

You mark your orders on a sheet and the stones are wheeled out on a cart with your protein (choices include shrimp, fish, lamb or steak). The server demonstrates how to cook the meat and explains how it works, then leaves you to cook to your liking. 

The meats are usually very tender - my favourite is the lamb, and the shrimp are good if you don't mind de-veining them yourself. The sashimi is unlimited, and cut thicker than most other AYCE places. The salmon is a favourite with its deep dark colour and fresh taste. Lots of sushi rolls (they're quite large in size, so order accordingly) and a few deep fried options, salads and even small bowls of ramen. They don't have a fried rice or noodle if you're looking for that though. Do try the deep fried oysters and the deep fried buns with condensed milk drizzled on top! 

Service can be a bit slow, but it is very friendly. There appears to be only one person in the kitchen, one person making sushi and one - maybe two if they're super busy - working the dining room. It's definitely a place you go for the experience and linger, not if you're in a super hurry. The food is quite good if you're ok with the price - about $50/person for dinner without alcohol.",4

Came in on Saturday for my birthday with my sister-in-law, hubby, and four kids in tote after discovering the place we had intended to dine at had closed :-(

But things happen for a reason sometimes, and I am sooooooooooo glad my sis-in-law suggested we give East a try.

The staff were welcoming from the minute we stepped in and available to answer any questions.  The menu is a tad confusing but they offer a picture book to go along with many of the numbered items to give you an idea of what you'll be getting.

I was really floored at the quality and the price point was exactly what I am looking for when dining out with the fam jam.

We shared so many delicious items - I'll try not to forget anything and of course there are pics uploaded :-)

Wor Wonton Soup - EXCELLENT ($13.95)!  Perhaps the best Wor Wonton Soup we've had to date and that's saying a lot!  The wontons themselves had little shrimp tucked into them next to the pork dumpling part.

Seafood in Szechuan Sauce was beyond delicious ($18.95)!  The only thing I'd like to see added to it is some squid - there were prawns, mussels, and a few scallops but squid would be a welcomed addition in my tummy!  The sauce was sweet and spicy perfection - my 7 year old niece and I would be quite happy to share this dish every time we come!

Another winner, winner was the Beef Rendang curry ($13.95)!  Soooo good, so much flavour, sooo tender.  The dish itself is just the beef in the curry (coconut milk, curry, and kaffir lime leaf) so I'd recommend ordering another dish with veggies or the phenomenal Melon of Plenty Wok Vegetables ($14.95) consisting of king oyster, wood ear, shimeji mushrooms, sugar peas, wolf berries, lotus bulb and root!  It was soooooooooooo freaking good!  I'm pretty sure there may have been a few more veggies in it like some broccoli but whatever was in it was perfections.  

Yet another reason to love EAST is they don't gauge you on stupid items like rice.  A side of white rice here is $1.50 and sides of coconut rice are only $2.50 or Hainan chicken rice is also only $2.50.  Nothing peeves me more than ordering a few curries that don't come with rice and then having to pay $5, $6, or $7 for a side of basic rice.  Two big thumbs up on this, East!

We shared a couple desserts as a group including a Black Glutinous Rice Pudding that seriously tasted like Christmas Cake (quite large - plenty for 2) and a magno pudding with sago pieces listed but I think it was more like lychee jelly pieces.  Bothe were great.

Hot Tea with Condensed Milk - delicious!  I'm used to having Vietnamese coffee but this was my first experience having the condensed milk in tea (offered both hot or cold) and it was delicious!

Ooh... and I almost forgot the Pork Fried Rice was a hit with the kiddos.  I mean, who doesn't like pork fried rice but it was EXCELLENT here!

The decor was beautiful with vibrant cloth panels and the restaurant itself quite clean.  And the washrooms were spacious, bright, and clean!

I really couldn't ask for anything more from East, except maybe to move to my neighbourhood!

I love truth in advertising. Whereas most Indian restaurants offer 2-3 kinds of chaat, there's so many here you have to come back to try them all. Come just for gol gappa (pani puri) or pao (pav) bhaji, which I haven't seen together on a menu in ages. Definitely get the chole bhatura (bhatoori), the bread is perfectly doughy without being greasy.  The chole was good too, nice spice and flavour depth, not too runny or too thick, and not sweet. I judge an Indian restaurant by the quality of it's chole (chana masala), and this version was better than average. I had to try the kulfi and it came out beautifully presented with just a little faloodah, a delicious treat.

We enjoyed our experience here. The server/owner was keen to explain his future plans for the newly renamed restaurant. He was attentive without being overbearing or pushy as we slowly chose which dishes to try.  He showed us to mix the green chilli and tamarind sauces without being condescending, and when we ordered our food as hot spice level, not a hint of food racism was detected.  The complimentary pappadams were a nice touch.

We came at around 6:30pm, and were the sole customers until about 7:30pm, when the restaurant quickly started to fill. We picked up some sweets on the way out, they tasted not bad, fairly average. There were some pretty and creative sweets shaped and coloured like fruit.

Recommended :)  All this goodness without the trip to India; great flavours brought back fond memories. Will be back to try the non-chaat dishes.",4

One complaint: the music they play is so LOUD! I have been coming here since they opened. Every time I have attempted to sit down and eat it is just so loud I need to leave (so it's not just a one time thing). So, for take out it is fine, but to even attempt to sit, or talk, is kinda out of the question. It feels more like a night club than a restaurant. I was here today with a friend, and we were going to sit- but we got up to leave after 2 minutes because of the music. Take out is great- but it would be nice to be able to sit there. Trying to find another place to eat and hear each other (or ourselves think) when they have a space there is kinda annoying.",4

We put our names on the list for pool, deciding that we'd play if our number came up before we were ready to leave. And with how long service took, you think that we would have gotten some pool in... but our number came up right when we were done (well, we were done before that but it took a while to flag down our waitress). The service was so lacking it was unfortunate. It took (what seemed like) forever for our waitress to come around each time. 

The beer selection is good, which was perfect, as I was really in the mood for one. I had one of their concoctions of lemonade and beer, which I thought would have been perfect for a sunny Saturday... but it was flat and disappointing. I would skip it next time and just order a bottled bevie and save the summer treat for home.

We shared dessert - mini donuts that didn't disappoint (mind you, I really hope that mini donuts never disappoint!) as they even came with caramel and chocolate dipping sauces.

""Spicy deep-fried chicken""

I love Korean fried chicken. With the extra-crispiness and flavourful, sticky glazes, it's much more appetizing than its dull American counterpart. And if spiced correctly, Korean fried chicken hits your stomach harder than a roundhouse kick from Tae Kwon Do pioneer, Jhoon Rhee. 

Over the years, my saucy affair with Korean fried chicken has taken me to great restaurants like Wow Pop, SFC, Pelicana, Gangnam, and Hanjan, transforming me into a slobbering fanatic.

Unfortunately, Daore insulted my fanaticism last night, with soggy, C-grade chicken, featuring minimal spice and a tepid sludge for a sauce. 

The haggard chicken, which had more loose skin than a Shar-Pei puppy, was the antithesis of what makes Korean fried chicken so great. And it wasn't crispy at all, suggesting that Daore didn't fry its meat twice - a must for Korean fried chicken.

It's a very nice little cafe (with exceptionally nice bathrooms). The trouble is, no one's put much thought into the service.

My friend and I went there on a sunny Saturday afternoon. We were told to sit and a waitress would take our order. We did. The waitress took about 7 minutes to come to our table. We ordered a cinnamon bun with cream cheese icing to share and two Tiramisu lattes. The lattes were decent. Very small, but tasted all right. 

The cinnamon bun, which we specified we were sharing, arrived on one plate with one small plastic container of cream cheese icing. Now the bun with icing is $5--a full dollar more than the bun without icing. For that price, I would expect the icing to at least be on the bun. My friend got up and asked for another plate. We cut the bun in half and went about spreading the two tablespoons of cream cheese icing on the massive bun. 

Turns out it was a container of rock-hard butter. We flag the waitress down, and she doubted that it was butter. My friend tried a second bite of it in front of the waitress and said, ""yah, this is definitely butter."" Seriously five minutes later, waitress comes back and says they are out of cream cheese icing. ""Okay,"" we say, ""just so long as we don't get charged for the bun with icing."" The bun itself was somewhat warm, like maybe someone put it in the microwave for 10 seconds. Flavour-wise, it was decent, but Cinnzeo cinnamon buns are about 12 times better.

The bill comes, and of course, she charged for the bun with icing. I go up to settle the bill. Three other employees are at the counter. One making a coffee, one making a smoothie. The other, who seemed to perhaps be the owner, was standing there doing nothing, staring at me. Finally she tells the other two that there's someone at the counter. They're like ""umm, we're preparing orders."" So this woman slowly and reluctantly saunters three paces over to help me. But she has no change, so she can't help me. The girl making coffee comes over and pulls money out of her own wallet to give me change.

This was the strangest experience I have ever had. It seemed like everyone working there had absolutely NO IDEA how to serve people or run a cafe. This place is a real disappointment. Looks are deceiving. It's a very beautiful cafe. The prices are quite high, but the service is awful. Will never return.",1

Shortly after, the appetizer rolled in - a generous portion of salad consisted of julienned vegetables with Reshmi Kebab meat. I started getting full, but then they brought out the main course. A huge plated butter chicken with vegetable sides and the Yukon Gold Patties. It was plated WAY cleaner and fancier than other Indian restaurants I had been to. The butter chicken was a WHOLE piece of juicy chicken breast rather than what I was used to (little cut up bits of chicken). It was served with garlic naan and when the naan ran out, the servers kept refilling tables with MORE NAAN! I LOVE MORE NAAN!

Its convenient location across the hotel, and right in the core of downtown Edmonton definitely influenced our decision to dine here.

We shared three different dishes: Aquavite char and toast, Brassica salad, and the barley risotto. All three were very good, there was a lot of creativity in the dishes and the combination of flavours in each dish resulted in very enjoyable products. I personally enjoyed the Brassica salad the best, although the Aquavite char and toast was a very second close. The three dishes proved to be enough to share among two people.

We also gave tried a couple of their cocktails. They were very interesting combinations. Mine was a bit sour and the only con I would give to it is that the glass in which it was served to me was sticky. However I would not demerit the overall drink because of that. My wife notably enjoyed her drink, until the last drop.

Our bill for two people, including two cocktails, came to about $70. I found that to be pretty reasonable, especially given the good quality of food and drinks, and the attentive service we received through the night.

We would definitely consider visiting again next time we are in Edmonton.",4

But one look at the menu told us we were in for a rude awakening.  There were five entrees ranging in price from $39-49 and it was difficult to tell from the description what they were going to taste like.  We were almost ready to bolt at that point and just give up the $25 we'd spent on the Groupon.  But we persevered.  

Normally, we would have ordered an appetizer, but at those prices, we opted out.  My husband selected the Alberta Beef which turned out to be a very tender 5 oz tenderloin served with a tiny rib, 2 tablespoons of cabbage, half a baby leek and one bite of pureed sweet potato (the chef clearly is not fond of vegetables).  Hubby was done eating in seven mins flat and he's not a fast eater, but there was just so little food on the plate.  I asked him how it tasted and he said 'average, ok, I could make something at least this good'.  Not exactly a rave review for $49.  

I ordered the duck.  It was five slices of duck breast served medium, but it was very chewy.  I could only eat one slice and then I gave up.  I put two slices on his plate because he was still hungry and he ate them, but he made a face as he chewed and then declined to eat any more.  There was a delicious duck confit in a raviolli shell that I loved.  If that had been the entire meal, I might not have minded the $46 price.  It was served with the same two tablespoons of cabbage, plus a tiny baby carrot and three tiny scoops of apple and a drizzle of puree.  When the server put the plates in front of us, my first thought was, oh my god, there's hardly anything on these plates.  

The service was the highlight of the dining experience and she was very polite, friendly and efficient.  But for $125 all in for only two entrees and a glass of wine, it was ridiculous.  We certainly won't be back.  I'm going to hazard a guess that the prices have gone up since the Groupon was issued because I can't see this being a favorite neighborhood joint at those prices.

(Asian-style?) Chili chicken - spot on.  The waiter gave us chopsticks too, which I found somewhat amusing as you can't really get this dish in Asia.  But that turned out to be a good call, when my colleague kept busting up the included deep fried (no idea what those pieces are) with her fork, and I was able to pick them up without a problem.  Served with sweet chili sauce.

Hot wings - just the right amount of kick.  Flavourful, but not deadly or ridiculously sour (common mistake with other places).  Actually one of the better ones I've had in a long time.

4-mushroom sirloin - quite tasty, but I honestly couldn't tell there were 4 types there.  I counted 2.  Served with a side of mashed pototoes, and some asparagus as well.  Pricey at $27, but I guess most people would get this for dinner.

The decor is cool, a very 50s diner feel complete with mini juke boxes at each table. They serve alcohol but it's a pretty limited selection - three beers on tap (all Alley Kat, at least while we were there), a few specialty cocktails, and a few wine options but not a wide choice. Service was very prompt also. I couldn't decide between the jambalaya and the po'boy, but it turns out Mondays are $12 po'boy day (they're normally around $16) so I decided to order the tiger shrimp po'boy with a side of jambalaya rice.

They started us off with a tiny bread roll each (what would be called a biscuit in the US) and jalapeno jelly spread to put on it, which was very tasty. My friend had got the sweet potato fries as a side and they were excellent, as many other Yelpers have noted. They were long - the full length of a sweet potato - and had been dipped in some kind of seasoned batter making them crispy and tasty outside. I'm not a huge fan of sweet potato normally, but these were really good.

Sadly however, my shrimp po'boy was deeply disappointing. I used to get shrimp po'boy from an amazing food truck in San Diego and I was looking forward to something similar - soft, fresh bun, lightly toasted; stuffed full with fat, juicy, battered shrimp; spiced sauce, and a little greenery just so you can pretend there's anything remotely healthy about it. Alas. The bun was dead cold, tasted about a day old, and hadn't even looked at a toaster; there were four sad and not extremely large battered shrimps lined up in a row on the bottom bun. A row of cold sliced tomatoes was stuck to the upper bun with some kind of only barely spiced mayo. And that was it. The jambalaya rice was simply white rice with some kind of creole seasoning added; okay but nothing special.  

I can't say I'm a world expert on shrimp po'boys, but this was by far the worst one I've encountered so far. They seriously need to up their bun quality game, and come on, maybe for $12 (or $16 normally) throw in more than four shrimp? This place had been so hyped up to me that I was very disappointed and am now rethinking my initial plan to go back sometime and try the jambalaya. I hope today's quality was an exception to the rule, because I'd hate to think this is really the best Cajun food you can find in Edmonton.",3

This truck is magical. The Scoop N Roll is all the rage on Instagram. If you haven't seen the photos yet, then you are missing out on the #instafood #foodporn trend. The best part is that photos on the rolled ice cream will not only look good on your social media, but it tastes DELICIOUS. 

The rolled ice cream concept was started in Thailand, and is now the best ice cream in town. It is fresh and made right in front of your eyes. Yes there is usually a line-up especially on hot days. But be smart! Head there on a weekday evening for less of a crowd.

STEP 1: Choose your ice cream flavour. Flavours include vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, banana, mango, Thai tea, coffee, coconut, avocado, pistachio and Matcha green tea. I am attempting to try all of them, but so far the pistachio is killer.

STEP 2: Choose two mix-ins/toppings (extras are 50 cents a piece). Toppings include blueberries, strawberries, mango, pineapple, banana, nutella, oreo, chocolate chips, mint chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, reese's,  m&ms, rainbow sprinkles, marshmallows or almonds. Some are mixed in, whereas others are added on top. There are additional mix-ins for a charge: cheesecake ($1), ferrero rocher ($1.50) and honeycomb ($2).

They also have specials of the week that are mentioned on their Instagram. So the options are unlimited!

Plus, the staff are hilarious and super chill. They always ask if you are new and where you heard about the truck. Check it out!",5

Jesus I just want to order a cake for my daughters birthday - decided to go elsewhere instead. How can I order a cake if no one knows pricing and sizes (because apparently not all the cakes can be done at certain sizes)?  Their cakes are nice, but I would recommend not wasting your time if you want to book a cake - not worth the time.",1

Unfortunately, on both visits at least half of our items were missing ingredients listed on the menu like green onions, sesame seeds, etc.

On our first visit, the hubs and I shared the Hardcore Dog ($8) and a 5 piece order of Sweet & Spicy Fried Chicken ($13).

The Hardcore Dog was probably the best of any of the items we tried over our two visits but as mentioned by another reviewer, the bun itself was difficult for me to chew and swallow - literally.  It was spicy - as noted - and full of flavour.

The 5 Piece Sweet & Spicy Chicken disappointed in quality and flavour.  It was  gooey mess of syrup poured over their standard fried chicken.  Some pieces of the chicken were standard like a drumstick or a breast but 2 of the 5 pieces were very odd and breakoff wing pieces that were quite small.  

Our second visit was with the whole fam jam in tote after a kiddo showing of Mike the Knight.  We shared The Truffle Mac 'n Cheese Dog ($9), the IT' Dog ($10), an order of Bulgogi Poutine ($7), and a side of plain fries ($3).  

The dogs are by far the best value here.  The IT' Dog was missing 2 of the listed ingredients and they were completely swamped so I didn't ask for them to be added.  We had to ask several times for our requested glasses of water.  

The Truffle Mac 'n Cheese sounded like a great idea and the thinly sliced jalapenos on top were a nice touch but it lacked the true flavour of cheese I was looking for.

My daughter loved the Bulgogi poutine, but for $7 even a tad more food would be good.  I'd rather pay a dollar more or slightly less but a small box half full wasn't enough for her.  My son has allergies to oh so many things so he had a plain side of fries which was about 1/3 of the small box filled - I uploaded pics as well.

My kids totally dug the decor here and spent a lot of time looking at the various comic book themed wall mountings.  And we're not just stalking Spider Man and Captain America, but the nitty gritty like Night Crawler as my 3 year old pointed out to me.

All in all, I'd come back if I was in the area and it was late at night but for the same price, I'd much rather go across the street to Original Joe's or to Three Boar's if they have space and enjoy the quality and atmosphere more so for almost the same price or slightly more.

There is some parking along the side of the restaurant as well as out back but it's a tricky space in the winter to say the least.  The IT' Dog is where Bad Ass Jack's used to be if that helps you find it and you'll recognize the colour and decor of Bad Ass in side as well as Jack himself in the washroom mural.",3

My understanding is that they used to be located in Edmonton's Little Italy, but moved to their new location for various reasons. And I'm glad they did, because I may not have discovered them otherwise.

They have something on the menu for every price range. You can opt for the deal of the day for $10 or so or you can get a more expensive entree from their menu if you would like. I often just go and get a custom bowl of pasta or the whatever the deal is that day. But everything on the menu is top-notch and you can tell a lot of energy went into the food preparation of whatever it is that you're eating. They also seem to specialize in seafood and have a lot of seafood options on the menu.

The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating as well. There was a mix-up with my reservation one time, but they made it work anyway and found me a table. The owner is often around as well to ask how everything is. No complaints there. And it's a cozy little restaurant too with red and white checkered tablecloths and good lighting.

I used to go here when it first opened in the late 1990s early 2000's. They used to have a roast baron of beef that they would carve off of when you would order a sandwich. They also did it with a beautiful pork roast. Now, their meat is cut in these weird cubes and it's put in a bunch of water in a steam table. Slow roasted beef is supposed to be full of flavour and my sub had no flavour in regards to the beef.. That was the whole point of the place and now that has all been obliterated. The bun was passable but isn't like it used to be either. Someone tried to streamline the operations and in the process they took away all the flavor. I don't recommend this place and I wish that they would make their menu smaller again and specialize in doing the roasts. It's too bad, this place was really cool back in the day.",1

There is lots of seating, it was clean and nicely decorated, and painted bright green! It made everything bright and cheerful! Love it!

I ended up getting the Vermicelli with Grilled Meat with shrimp added to it. The food was pretty good, the meat had a nice spice to it and smelled delicious and the noodles were good as well but kind of on the cold side. The shrimp was grilled and it was excellent except they only gave 3 small shrimps and only one had the tail ( I love the tails!!) 
They had added to it  bean sprouts and lettuce and while the bean sprouts were fresh and crunchy the lettuce was brown and old which I was kind of disappointed with. They also added some complimentary spring rolls which were delicious! They had meat in them which I love. Restaurants seem to only ever have the vegetarian kind these days. 

The woman working the counter was extremely friendly and very happy to help me out when I asked about the food. Customer service was excellent!

I would give this place 3 1/2 Stars just because the portion of food was kind of small compared to the price and there should have been more meat along with the noodles and the veggies. To many sprouts and lettuce! Hopefully once they have been opened for awhile and work the kinks out I'll give it 5 stars :)",3

My first visit, there were more customers and I found the food portions were a little bit bigger.  Understandably, the portion sizes seem to be smaller now as the profit margin might be different.  I still found that ordering two items would sufficient food for me, and if you're coming with a friend or two, sharing items is a good way to try more items.  The first time around, I had the donair and side salad and enjoyed it.  The second time, donair seemed a bit smaller but still tasty.  The fish was a big piece the first time but second time a lot smaller. 

The décor is cool, and love the KISS mural being a KISS fan.  I also like pinball, but I don't think the machines were working either time.  It can get loud with the music so conversing in raised voices might be needed.  Service was ok, nothing outstanding.

Staff is efficient and low key  but very good.
You have a menu and a paper where you fill in squares if you want to build a soup.
The menu has lots of goodies on it you don't see in  other places as appetizers so i pretty much wanted to eat everything.
I settled for building a soup with the extra hot little sheep broth,the thin vermicelli  rice noodles,beef brisket and pork meat balls.
As well i ordered a spicy won ton appetizer which has 6 won tons in a chili sauce. 
The broth was excellent.Just spicy enough to make my mouth tingle and very lively and colourful.
The meats were great as well. 
The wontons are good and addictive.
After i was done i ordered some preserved egg congee which i hadn't seen in the places i go very often.

They had a group of 150 people from the same local sports group taking up the entire main dinning room with a reservation.  Then there was a group of 20 or so in another location, and a reservation of 10.  What this means is that at the time we arrived, there was only 7 tables available for those who were not part of the larger parties.  Which was a nightmare for the hostess at the front door.

When we walked in, there was one group waiting ahead of us.  The hostess was honest and told us that it would likely be a wait of anywhere from 15 - 30 minutes, since with a buffet you really can't anticipate how long people will take to finish their meals.  She explained the extreme seating limitations and said that if we would prefer to go to one of their other locations, she would give us 2 for 1 coupons.  We decided to wait. 

The wait ended up being closer to 40 minutes, but we really didn't mind.  We were having a great time with the hostess and the time passed quickly.  

When our table was ready, we followed the hostess into a few cramped room.  We understood though, so it wasn't the end of the world.

We went up for our first round of food and the buffet area was PACKED!  There were huge lineups with no rhyme or reason.  Buffet Royale loses major points for how their buffet is set up.  When it was being designed, the focus was definitely on getting more seating in.  All the buffets are up against the walls, so you can't go to both sides of it (with the exception of the small chinese food selection).

Overall the food is just so-so.  The roast beef was over cooked and dry.  The only thing that was really enjoyable was the chinese food.  They do that very well.  Everything else is bland and unexciting though.

When we first got there and checked in with the hostess, she asked us how many children under 12 and seniors we had (we had one of each) and she wrote it down on our order chit.  However, when our server put it all in the computer, he didn't pay attention to that and just put it all in as regular buffet.  I caught it right as my brother was paying and got them to fix it.  Mistakes happen, but it was frustrating.

My nephew really likes it here, so I know we'll be back. But it's never my first choice.",3

Although I tend to stick to the seafood dishes the spaghetti with meatballs is also amazing for a treat. Basically anything that they put the tomato sauce on is heavenly.

I bought a half dozen - 2 cookie dough, 1 red velvet, 1 Georgia Brown, 1 coffee and 1 birthday cake. I tried a bit of the cookie dough and Georgia brown and wow - the cookie dough is something I would certainly come back for! The Georgia Brown has cream cheese and cinnamon so it's exactly what you expect it to taste like, and it's done very well. The dough on that cake is a little less sweet, so it goes very nicely with the cream cheese. But that cookie dough is on another level - if you thought you know what cookie dough icing tastes like you probably don't because wow they hit the nail right on the head. Not only that but the cake part of the cupcake was so tasty, with a nice layer of cookie dough at the bottom. This one was sweeter than the Georgia brown but I didn't find it to be too much.

The late evening visit was horrible. The mature crowd was replaced with a young nightclub crowd and MMA t-shirts. The service was worse. The servers don't have the skills to manage a large crowd. We waited at our table for 15 minutes before being noticed and it took another ten before I had to get the manager. From counting the number of servers, I can't say they were understaffed, just underperforming.

The Mercer could be so much better. Fortunately, there are a number of great taverns/gastro-pubs that have opened in Edmonton since the Mercer. I will probably return one day with the hope that they have figured out how to improve.",2

The first time I went in was on the first day they opened, to try a coffee.  They made my cappuccino dry (i.e. not a latte with a bit extra milk foam) and I found the fresh roasted coffee very flavourful.  
A couple weeks later, I came in with my little sister to try dinner.  We had the bruschetta pomodoro to start, which was very flavorful, and an appropriate sized serving for the $4.75 we paid for it.  We also had two pizzas, the Gorgonzola and the picante (which my sister ordered mild.)   The Gorgonzola was blue cheese, green apple and walnut, an excellent combination, and the picante was four cheese with tomato sauce, good for picky eaters.  We found the size to be quite generous and each ended up taking home about half a pizza.  Service is friendly and the owners are clearly very involved in managing the place.  We found the pace a bit slow, but that might have been because a) the waitstaff is brand new to the place and b) we were really really hungry.
I also had a couple glasses of wine, which were a bit pricey but went well with the food.  It looked like ordering a bottle would have been much more reasonably priced.  My sister had a Mega C smoothie which tasted like an orange ice cream milk shake.  We agreed that it was quite tasty.
In short, Cafe Tiramisu is a wonderful place to go and chill out.  The food is good, and as others have mentioned, the decor is stunning, and the staff is friendly and competent.  As we were leaving to go to the Roxy, a girl was setting up to do live music Friday.  I would definitely go back.",4

But sometimes... you want it fast, cheap and to go.
Enter Tokyo Express.

I have been spoiled, as I have lived downtown for the last 20 years, and my local TE was the Oliver Square location, which has always been great. I know the people who run it, and they have pride in their food. It shows.

Recently, however, circumstances have relocated me to Mill Woods, and Oliver Square is too far for fast, and cheap.
The closest Tokyo Ex to me is this one, on 23 ave.
I dropped in last week for a light nosh, around 8:30 and ordered up a Maki Combo to go. (It's all to go these days, isn't it?)
I was the only customer, so things went reasonably quickly. My order was up in 10-15 min.
When I got it home, I opened the package to the sloppiest maki rolls I have ever seen. A couple of them had unraveled completely in the box, and those that were still complete had gaps in the nori wrap, and the rice was hard and slick, so the rolls were not staying together.
Overall, they tasted stale, even though I had watched them being made, minutes before.
I ate them, as I had paid for them and I was hungry, but I was disappointed.
The Maki you buy at 7-11 would have been better.

Tonight, I was craving the Teriyak Chicken Rice Bowl, and I thought I would give them a second chance. When I pulled up to the restaurant, there were a number of people inside, as it was 6:30PM, and it was the Saturday dinner rush.
I stood in the doorway, safely distanced, and watched, waiting for an opportunity to order.
I never got to order.
It was just shy of 15 minutes before I was acknowledged by anyone of the 2 people on staff.
What I was watching was a restaurant sinking into the weeds so badly, I don't know if they ever got out.
I think I stayed as long as I did out of sheer morbid fascination.

The expediting was a mess. They had stuff all over the place, and no idea what bag it was for.
The Skip orders went out before in person customers. In the time I was there, I did not see a person leave with an order who was not carrying an insulated bag.
2 staff for a Saturday dinner rush. Neither seemed to know what was going on.
Phone ringing, unanswered.
An alarm going off for 8 minutes, untouched.
At about the 14 minute mark, the lady at the counter said, ""I'll take your order in a minute."" ( or words to that effect. I could not understand her)
I watched for another 5 minutes, inwardly hoping to see them pick up the reins and pull it together, but my second thoughts kicked in and asked, ""Do you really want to eat anything that comes out of this chaos?""
The answer was, ""no.""
With a muted, ""F**K this,"" I turned and walked out.

I will not be returning to this Tokyo Express any time in the future.

I drove back home and stopped into delightful noodle joint and got Satay Beef Soup to go, and it was magnificent.
But that is another, much better review.",1

He didn't offer us anything new - he went and talked to an older gentleman (maybe a manager? owner?) and when he came back he said we could upgrade our free ice cream to the sesame ice cream for free (that would have cost us $1 each - so they offered us $2 for serving us bad meat). 

We decided to leave and asked for the bill. While waiting, we saw the older man our server talked to, go to the back and then the people in the kitchen started staring/glaring out the window at us. It was all very uncomfortable. 

We paid (full price) and left feeling sick, uncomfortable at everything and mad that we just paid $90 ish. It was one of our favourite places and we will never return after this experience.",1

It was nestled with lime mayo and pickled cabbage. Fantastic combination and really filling.  My husband loved his well done Gatsby Burger.

It's got a lot of kinks to iron out because the place is new. Right now it's just an insanely expensive average experience. 

This is the new restaurant in the JW, Ice District. Finding this place is difficult, as they have parking but at the moment it's not really complete. I'm here to save the day though, and get you through this maze. You park in the underground parkade off 103 Ave, near Stantec tower. If you blink you will miss this parkade due to construction all around it, so keep your eyes out. After that, go into the parkade, up to the main lobby of the Stantec, and it is directly across the street. Don't try to go in through the patio doors, they keep them locked. Go around the building to the front of the JW and then you will see it. There is a lobby bar, walk past the lobby bar and you are there. I feel the need to explain this because getting here was definitely a bit crazy. But, hey, free parking!

So we get to the hostess stand, get checked in (you need to give your license plate for the parkade), and the restaurant itself is behind the wine wall! The decor is beautiful! We were seated at a nice four-person table, chairs were very comfortable! I just felt very fancy. If you guys know me, you know I like to pretend to be fancy when I'm actually not (lol).

Our server was awesome, when she was there. She was running around like a mad-woman trying to handle all her tables. She did a great job considering the circumstances. It took about a half hour for her to get our wine to us, which is a pretty long time considering that we hadn't even ordered our food before our wine. It was at this point that I knew we were in for a rough 3-3.5 hours. But I get it, it's ironing out the kinks. 

We ordered a Burgundy ($84) and a Gamay Noir - the Gamay was the least expensive ($58), however, I think you're pretty safe in ordering any wine that is on the ""cheap"" side because the price doesn't really matter. It is very clear that they have spent the time to carefully construct their gorgeous wine menu! When looking through it I could tell that you're basically safe with any wine because of the time and care it takes to create a menu like that. All stunning wines and different varieties. I obviously preferred the Burgundy because I'm a boss, but the Gamay was delicious as well.

I take a big issue with the size of the font on the menu. I mean, come on, why do I need a magnifying glass to read this? You have so much space and should make the font bigger! Even our server was squinting trying to read which items/wines we were trying to order. I totally get wanting to have a nice aesthetic, but this is hurts my eyes. 

We ordered a bunch of menu items to try, the Chargrilled Salmon, the Cauliflower, Onion Rings, Fried Squid, Hamachi Sashimi, mashed potatoes and the Rib Eye. I'm a pescatarian/mostly plant-based, so I did not try the Rib Eye. I was very impressed by the Chargrilled Salmon and the Cauliflower dishes. But I was totally taken aback by how BOMB the mashed potatoes were. I had to laugh because they totally stole the show for me. YUM! I was very pleased with the Salmon and Cauliflower as well. 

For dessert we order this Black Forest Eton Mess Sundae and it was so underwhelming. That was my least favourite part of the meal. It looks like you're about to stuff your face with delicious brownies. But what it actually is, is layers of whipped cream and a tiny bit of ice cream, brownies and cookies and a bunch of maraschino cherries to fill the space. Two big slices of some kind of merengue to make it seem like it isn't just a bowl of whipped cream. For $21, you're better off going home. 

So yeah, kind of an average experience for the first time. I'm definitely going to come back in a few months when they iron out the kinks. I like the space and I want to give it the shot it deserves. You can tell they put a lot of work into it. Right now, however, it needs some work. I wouldn't make it a regular spot until the future. 

I will, however, be back to spend a bunch of $$$ when I recover from this.",4

This review is strictly for online shopping and my experiences with deliveries. I have been using this service since I moved to my condo a few years ago. It is my only option and I can't choose another store in my area. I mostly use it in winter months for large bulk orders.

Too many times orders have arrived very late - 30 minutes to 1 hour without a call letting me know that the order is late. The truck is supposed to call when they're 15 minutes away. Sometimes they call five minutes away. Sometimes they don't. It's a real pain when you're given a two hour window and waiting for a buzz on the old intercom system. 

I know now to include substitute suggestions when placing orders online because I've received orders where half the items were substituted and I wound up with a bags of food I didn't want. Now I know better. 

What really ticks me off is when more than a few items aren't in stock - they don't bother to call you to let you know. You wait two hours for the delivery and get the bag and it's only half the order you wanted.

I've been wanting service to get better but the real problem is with the store over booking deliveries. And as I'm writing this, I just received a call that the order I have waited 2.5 hours, is an hour behind!

I'm just done with this store. I'll be contacting the head office to see if I can use another location or will be finding another service all together.

Update: Five minutes after hitting the post button on this, the driver called saying he'd be here in ten minutes. No word of apology. Nothing to explain why he was so late. And then he tells me that I should be placing orders between 4 and 6 because our doors lock at 6? Are you freaking kidding me? I am so beyond frustrated at the lack of care from staff. I asked the store to CANCEL the order - and yet it was still delivered. I accepted it grudgingly, but still pretty ticked off.",2

They do start running out of flavors near the end of the day so make sure to go earlier if you want a full selection of flavors.

I've tried the following:
-Toasted Hay and Saskatoon Berry: quite good and you can taste the distinct hay flavor

-Banana Foster Rum Caramel: very strong banana rum taste but it was enjoyable

-Chinook Bee Pollen and Lavender:if you like lavender then this is the flavor for you. It was refreshing

-Moonshine Brown Butter Pecan: pecans gave it a good crunch and moonshine taste was light

-Maple Bacon Pancake: this was surprisingly delicious. I love the pancake bites and bacon was a nice touch

Overall what makes this place different is their very unique flavors. Not all flavors will be at  everyone's liking as I sampled a few I didn't like (ie. Dill pickle & peanut butter).",4

My wife had been here for a company function and has not stopped raving about how good it was. Which is understandable because it was awesome!
I had the carpaccio of kobe beef to start - very nice - the homemade chips and aioli were superb. Nice to actually go to restaurant that knows what aioli is - instead of the fob-off some places give..
There then followed the most amazingly cooked fish I've ever had. The Sea Bass. I come from Scotland and our choice of seafood restaurants is pretty good- however I've never eaten fish that has been that perfectly cooked! It literally just melted in the mouth. My wife says that's the first time she's ever seen me 'roll my eyes back in my head when eating food'! Just amazing. The rest of the dish was brilliant too - although the lobster pancakes could have had just a little bit more lobster in them.
My dessert was the creme brûlée with bacon/maple donut. While I'm not a great fan of bacon on desserts this actually passed because the bacon bits were of the consistency of walnuts and kind of accentuated the flavour of the donut. 
All in all a superb meal - definitely going back there again!",5

I shared the wine flight of the week with my date and it was ok - I really didn't find any of the wines particularly good (and the last red was far too tart), and I wouldn't have bothered buying any of them by the glass. I understand it's a tasting menu, but expected a bit better quality since it was supposed to lure you into buying more of those specific wines. 

Our waitress was good, but a bit of a pest - we were only there for just over an hour, and she came by A LOT. I'd have appreciated the level of service more if she hadn't specifically asked each time if we'd like to order something else - I understand that her take home for the night will be low from the lack of customers, but didn't appreciate the implication that we should be who boosted it, as each time she came round, she had another 'suggestion' of what we should purchase!

Either way, I liked them enough that I'll be going here in the very near future.

As they were part of the featured dessert at the small summer wedding, our friends displayed them on a homemade ""doughnut mind if I do!"" board. Honestly, this is the way to go for serving them to a small crowd of people. Also kept them from being in the box too long (but really with that taste, I don't think that would have been an issue anyways, lol).

This place is definitely pricey - our bill came to $145 before tip including 1 fancy non-alcoholic drink and 1 Caesar. 

The cheese fondue itself was awesome (we got the 4 cheese option) and I would totally just sit there and be content eating the fondue from a spoon. I found that the bread they gave us to dip in the cheese was boring. It tasted like the French loaf you get from superstore for $1 

The meat options we got were all good, but I just found it kind of weird boiling my beef and chicken pieces in broth (is it just me?). 

The chocolate fondue was awesome. Maybe I'm a bit biased though because we both just LOVE chocolate. The s'mores was sooooo good.

We left full and with very sore backs and asses; probably because we sat there for 3 whole hours to complete the meal. Their little private booths for two people don't have very supportive seating, FYI

This place from the outside does not look very appealing at all, but once you step inside it was very clean and aesthetically pleasing.

The service was friendly but they have these push call buttons for when you want to call the waitress over.  When we were first seated it did take a few minutes extra than normal to get our menus and when we were ready to order we had to push the button for her to arrive.  In a way I liked this as they don't bother you and you can call them over whenever you do need something.  She did check on our table a couple of times to make sure everything was going well.

You can choose from hot pot, where you can get different sizes of giant pots of soup that you can cook at your table (in table cooker), or Korean bbq that they cook and bring to you (they said they may eventually allow you to grill at your table) or other traditional Korean food.

We decided to go with the Korean bbq to try it out.  The beef short ribs were the THICKEST I have ever seen at a Korean restaurant, and they were fresh, juicy and just the right amount of fat cooked to perfection!  The pork was also very juicy and not a single dry spot throughout (whereas I'm used to even some parts being dry else where!).  They also do something to their rice that enhances the flavour slightly and it is much appreciated.

First - I lived nearby when they started building.  I was shocked that they were adding this large complex to this particular parking lot, which already housed the movie theatre and Earls.  On a Friday or Saturday night, it was already difficult to find parking there.   But whatever... they must know what they're doing (they clearly don't).

Anyway.. moving on to my experience.  The doors are clearly marked as to which one is the Entrance and which is the Exit.  So, we went in the Entrance and were stopped by security, telling us to go outside and in the other door.  Not a bit deal, but threw us off a little.  Once you get inside.... Well, I don't think I've ever been more confused.  There were 4 security guards at the door.  And a bunch of people who looked like movie theatre ushers.  The first ""usher"" stopped us and asked us what we were there for that night.  I said, ""well, we've never been here before, but we were looking for some dinner!"".  Usher #1 explained that there was the downstairs restaurant, which had a 30 - 40 minute wait, or the lounge upstairs, or the donut and poutine shed.  We said we'd probably wait for the restaurant.  She pointed to a counter and told us we'd have to give them our name to get on the waitlist.

Great.  We start walking towards the counter and we're stopped by another usher.  Usher #2 asks as us the same question and we have the exact same conversation.  On to the counter... At the counter there are 2 more ushers.  Usher #3 explained the same thing as the first two and then told us to give our names to Usher #4.  So we did, and were given the little pager thing.  We asked if we could go sit at the bar while we wait, they said yes.  

So, we headed into the restaurant and notice at least 7 empty tables.  So... I'm guessing that the wait is actually because they did not have sufficient staff.  We sat at the bar.  There were a few other patrons at the bar, and a number of staff.  We sat... and sat.  There was a weird smell.  I smelled a combination of hot sauce and cleaning supplies, but my friend smelled B.O.

Nobody ever acknowledged us.  No menus, no drinks. Nothing.  So we got up and left.  When we handed the pager back to Usher #3, she said, ""thanks, have a good night!""

But the entree menu is limited although I believe they change it up every month or so.  There's a larger appetizer menu and drink menu with various cocktails.  Both times I had the Chicken Cordon Bleu and the presentation was lovely but it also tasted good.  The potatoes were perfectly cooked, the veggies and Parmesan crusted tomato were a good addition to the chicken breast cut in 2 halves.  It was also a good value as we had a 2 for 1 coupon.  The price of the pop is less than $3, and bottled beer for $7.  They also provide a piece of birthday cake if you let them know you're celebrating.

The live music on Fridays night is provided by The Architects from 8-11 and they play above the bar and there's an area for dancing.  If you let them know it's a special occasion, they will give a shout out.  After 11, the DJ spins the tunes. They also have special events as recently they have a Titanic theme event and I saw people dressed up, fun! 

What I like about Halley's is it's not overly crowded, there's room to dance, and the music is a good variety so the band plays a good mix for the younger and older crowd.  The DJ played newer music that I wasn't familiar with but still fun to dance.  It's a place I'll be back to again!",4

I would never have believed that an exclusively chicken restaurant would be as amazing as this was but I was blown away by the portions, service and then, of course, the taste of the meal. 

I've only been for lunch but this casual dine in restaurant has such a nice atmosphere.  You walk in, get seated with menus and then place your order at the cash register.  They then bring you your meal.  It's a nice combination of fast food and full serve.   You can order a different spices on the chicken - from mild to crazy hot so everyone can get what they want.  And, they have great sides or starters - wedges, fries, olives, garlic mashed potatoes.  

But, if you do end up sharing - you can always get a little extra sauce for yourself.  All of the sauces are on the side for you to add a little extra flavour - or to take home.  They sell the sauces as well which is an extra bonus for those of us who have fallen for the flavour and want to take it home with us!  Now, the issue is to figure out which one to buy....",5

Decent thin crust pizza!  And from a chain!

Needed a bite to eat after some shopping and before going to the airport, so South Edmonton Common's Famoso location is perfect.  Nice decor.

An unusual style of ordering where you fill out your order card and take it to the central cashier for processing.  You can start up a tab and order additional items as you go, then you settle your bill at the end.

Food comes pretty quickly after you order and although it's not the best thin crust pizza I've had, it's totally decent.  We shared the prosciutto arugula and the BBQ chicken.  Yum... good ratio of crust to toppings to sauce (if a red pizza).  I would totally get these again, but am definitely tempted by the funghi and the vesuvio versions on the menu!

Prices are around $12-$15 for a pizza which feeds one, or max two people with smaller appetites.",4

The service was pretty lacking. I was greeted quickly and ushered to a seat by myself in a corner on arrival.  It took a good couple minutes to get a menu and drink order and the place wasn't very busy at all. 

I ordered an iced Vietnamese coffee and the house special Pho. 
The soup came and it looked very nice. The beef was still rare, lots of tripe and a fair portion of noodles. Although the large soup was small in comparison to other pho places in the city (I'd say have the size of Maki Maki's) The taste was pretty generic. Nothing special. 

The waiter didn't come by again after delivering my order and though I was finished, my dishes weren't cleared, nor was my tab offered to me. I waited about 10 minutes and finally paid for my meal at the counter.

The portion sizes are huge; I normally cannot finish a meal but I can usually get 3 meals out of my one pasta dish.

Appetizers: Bestie had seaweed salad, and I had Miso soup. REALLY impressed with both. My soup had generous amounts of tofu, seaweed and green onion. Bestie raved about the salad.

Bestie had a rice bowl, and I actually tried something new for a change--not a bento box. There were only two options for bento boxes and neither appealed to me. So I had the cold noodles, which came with veggies, chicken and these perfect boiled eggs...I'd love to know how they make those. I'm still thinking of how uniquely tasty they were. Maybe they soak them in a broth after peeling them...? So good!

We also ordered the assorted sashimi. I think it might be the best I've had in Edmonton, or anywhere actually. Sooooo fresh! The textures and temperature were perfect!

I pulled a star because of the service. It's a little spotty. They were all super sweet and polite, but not very attentive. We had to flag them down for things like napkins and hot water for tea. They didn't clear any dishes, and the sashimi arrived when we were almost finished. (But yeah. Worth the wait.)

Usually I'm a dragon about service, but the food was so good, I didn't care much. I'm still thinking about those flavors a day later.

However the dealbreaker for me was the poor quality of tapioca and jelly. Tapioca was overcooked and almost dissolved, and the jelly was soft and squishy instead of chewy. You can tell the tapioca is not good because it is almost transparent (overcooked).
If there is a silver lining, their roasted milk tea was very interesting. It has a distinct tea-coffee flavor that is reminiscent of traditional milk tea but with a new and progressive twist.

Over the years it lost some of its charm, but still ranked as one of the better dining experiences in Edmonton. I'm sad to say that my first experience at the newish Culina Muttart was a disappointment. 

Culina Muttart is nestled in Edmonton's beautiful River Valley inside the Muttart Conservatory. They are open for brunch, lunch and occasional dinner. A couple weeks ago I was finally able to go for brunch after wanting to try out the restaurant for almost a year.

The restaurant is small, but provides enough room to fit about 40 people. The large windows allow great lighting and a very welcoming atmosphere. I was lucky enough to get a table without waiting as there was only one table free. Brunch has a small, but enticing menu, that ranges from $8 - $15. A good price for brunch in Edmonton, especially if their food compared to Culina Mill Creek.

Unfortunately this is where things took a downturn. I had a regular coffee which I never expect too much of, but it was watered down and light brown in colour. I hadn't had a cup of coffee that bad in my life. The next cup was equally watered down, I knew if I came back I would have a latte or juice instead.

I ordered the Benedict Special that was two eggs with basil hollandaise served with dijon hash browns and a small salad. Now I don't mind waiting for food while I have a cup of coffee and good conversation, but eventually the conversation turned to just talking about where the food was. It took just under an hour for the food to arrive after ordering, way too long for brunch especially without any explanation from a server.

So... long wait, but it could totally be worth it. And the food could have been good, but someone didn't season anything and the eggs and hollandaise had no taste. The basil in the hollandaise added little flavour and the sauce itself was way too thick to even be considered hollandaise, it was more like creamy mayonnaise on top of the eggs. It was very underwhelming after waiting so long. I expected so much more. 

I don't know if it was just an 'off' day for Culina Muttart or maybe someone new was in the kitchen. I will try it again, but I would not recommend it based on the experience I had.",2

Arrived at 7pm and was told that there was nothing available until 11pm bacause of previous party bookings and in fact that they were overbooked (what a LIE!!!). 

Two of my friends and i decided to stay hoping that maybe something will become available. In the meantime, while not even half of the lanes were occupied, we tried to ask if we can play at least a game each or let us play until someone that needs the lane shows up and we will willingly terminate our game. Unfortunately, the answer was a big NO and they added that the reservations will start at 8pm. 

Well, we finally left at 9:15pm and only then when people started to come in. What a joke to run a business!!! I wonder if the owners are actually aware of how they are losing money from the unnecessary ""turnaways"". While we were there (for two hours, yes we are bowling fanatics), we observed several people being turned away while more than half of the lanes were empty.

I also have recently been elected co-subchairwoman of the LLP (Loony Loaners Parade), an annual family event celebrating Edmonton's diverse finance industry.  So as you can see, my roots are so deep here that I don't have the time or luxury to travel outside Alberta, and frankly, nor would I want to, because the low bar of artistic and culinary expectations that Edmonton has set for me feels safe, while any external forays into culture are overwhelming, confusing, terrifying, and frequently violate the minimal expectations of the world around me which Edmonton has so magnificently instilled into me. 

There are those special moments in your life when all your hard work is rewarded in the most breathtaking way. For my efforts as LLP co-subchairwoman, I was awarded a gift certificate for two tickets to Jubilations Dinner Theatre! How was it...? Well, I guess my five-star review might be a spoiler alert LOL! The truth is, Jubilations Dinner Theater is the PERFECT combination of high-class entertainment and gourmet food for any Edmontonian like me who has absolutely no expectations of quality whatsoever! If you're looking to spend a night out wining and dining on the best food with a taste of Broadway-caliber theatre, maybe for a special event or just for kicks, you're lying to yourself! You're in Edmonton! Life here is good enough (at best), and you're not talented, interesting, or successful enough to have escaped yet.

So now, since you're here, if what you're REALLY looking for is a bad Middle School play written, produced, and acted by retards, that you watch amidst a bunch of barely-alert elderly people slurping up food that Vegas buffets donated from leftover airline food stock, you are going to LOVE this experience!

As a big fan of such television entertainment as The Big Bang Theory and Two and a Half Men, I'm used to turning off my brain and drooling over a reheated meatloaf while I escape from the banality of my tedious job by way of the banality of garbage entertainment. So it was a super neat treat to get dressed up and go have that same experience live and in person with 100 other slack-jawed skinsacks who, like me, actually laughed and clapped at this grade school mess of a production and ate their reheated gruel with pleasure, because, like me, they just don't know any gosh darn better!

In summary, you wouldn't be reading this if you didn't live in Edmonton. And if you still live in Edmonton, let's be honest, you're never going to get out. So release your delusions of grandeur and get your tickets right now, because going to the mall to watch a bunch of drama school drop-outs sing out of tune while half-retarded people wearing bad wigs serve you leftovers from the local prison is the best it's going to get around here, and you know it.

However, for two reasons, I'm making an exception. I chose this location simply because it's the one closest to my home and the one I frequent the most often.

The first reason is BP's Sombrero Pizza. They used to have way back in the day and I haven't had one in probably 15 years. So when I went in on Father's Day it really made my day to see it back on the menu after so long (and so many other favourites have been removed from the menu). 

If you've never had a Sombrero pizza, it's basically a taco/burrito in pizza form. They take pizza dough and spread refried beans, sauce, spicy ground beef and mozzarella cheese on it and bake it until everything is crispy. Then they pull it out of the oven and sprinkle cold lettuce, tomatoes, cheddar cheese on top and drizzle that with ranch dressing. This gives you a warm crispy bottom and cool, refreshing top. Amazing! 

The second reason is BP's has really stepped up their game for kids. 

Most restaurants have a placemat and some crayons for your kids to doodle on before the meal arrives. BP steps it up a notch with an activity booklet that has games, puzzles, hidden pictures and a decoder toy, as well as crayons! I have to admit, I was kind of jealous when the server gave my daughter her menu - it brought back so many memories from my childhood. 

Their kids meals also offer half a dozen different options in the main course, side dish and drink departments (several of them healthy too), then top it off with a customizable sundae as dessert. Kids never had it so good! 

All in all, BPs really impressed me the last time I went. I will be back, if only to have another Sombrero pizza!",4

The food is fantastic! Prepare to take your time while choosing what fish to order. There is cod, hallibut, sole and haddock. If you cannot make up your mind, go for the combo dish, where you get a piece of each kind of fish on the menu. The pieces are of a very generious size, by the way. The chips are crispy and non-greasy. And the green curry sauce for the fish is to die for! Oh, and don't forget to order some ale!

Time and time again I've had anything but a good experience at this location and the main focus of it has to do with the food quality and lack of quality care.

  I ordered a Mcdouble with LIGHT  pickles and onions, and also asked that mac sauce be added to the burger, instead I receive a barely warm burger with nothing that I asked for. There were no onions, only one pickle in the burger, and the sauce was extremely minimal that you couldn't even taste the mac sauce.

  On top of getting a burger I asked for 10 piece nuggets, not even 10 seconds into eating my meal and I realized my nuggets were so cold and old, it's almost like they scrapped the scraps of nuggets that fell on the floor, dusted off the debris and garbage on them and served them to me. So that enraged me a little bit. The only thing that was half decent about my meal was the fries and even that was still soft and old.

  I know it's not a 5 star restaurant and I understand that working at McDonald's for minimal pay sucks all together. But you're in the service industry and rules and standards are placed and set in motion for a reason. If you can't care enough to make sure the customers food is at least somewhat fresh and visually appealing, then quit your job and beg mommy and daddy to buy you everything you want and watch your butt get kicked to the curb so hard, by the time you realize it, you'll be in your 30s homeless and lonely.

  Please do us all a favor and do one of 2 things: either...

1. Demolish the building so that it ceases to exist or...

2. Fire these careless young punks and bring more immigrants from the Philippines because at least people from there actually do their best  and some barely speak the language.

Popped in one day to check it out, and walked out with a maple cupcake that was, indeed, delish-ious!

So, I thought it had passed the test enough to order a Black Forest Cake from them for my 2-year anniversary with my husband. But I was disappointed by it. It was a chocolate cake, with two layers of cherry filling, and whipped cream instead of frosting, topped off with some cherries. This would have been good for a ""Cherry Chocolate Cake"", and the actual texture of the cake was moist and fluffy --- quite good, actually! But I think it was wrongly advertised as a Black Forest Cake.

I was expecting some chocolate frosting or mousse for the filling, with cherry baked into the actual cake layers, chocolate frosting coating, perhaps even some chocolate shavings or curls, and topped with cherries. 

Given that it was just a 6"", I think $18.50 was a bit much for what I got. The quality of this cake was something I would have been able to make. If I had known they were not going to make it the normal way, I would have made it myself. To top it off, their website is not up to date (website said it was only $15, but I was still charged their new price), and I had emailed an entire week ahead to make my order, but received no reply. By 2 days before my anniversary I had to call, only to find out they hadn't gotten my email at all (sounded like they don't even check it on a regular basis!).

I'd recommend popping in for their cupcakes or any of the other delightful treats they have available on a daily basis. I also give them a thumbs up for having gluten-free and vegan options upon request. But I doubt I'll be ordering a cake from them again.",3

I've actually honestly never experienced a worse customer experience than this in my life without exaggeration. I went there this afternoon and so this lady server comes up to take my order. I could see that she was struggling with her English so I made sure I pointed to her what we wanted. Sure enough the food comes and it's not what I ordered. Basically I requested her to change it to what I initially ordered which was a vegan beef sate soup. I was totally caught off guard when the supposedly assistant manager and the server ganged up on me and told me that I didn't order correctly and i would need to pay for another dish if I want it changed 
I guess they could quickly tell that I was a student with my school bag and knew that I wouldn't take that option, which also somehow makes me an easy push over at the same time ... Later on when I went up to pay and asked to speak to the manager, the lady told me that he is her younger brother and he listens to her and so basically there was nothing I could do. i did express to her my disappointment in the way she treated me, well sure enough I was again speaking to a wall cos she bluntly brushed me off.",1

It was a special treat when my mom took me here, so it had a lot of fond memories attached to it. I hadn't been for a few years, as I felt that this establishment had lost it's touch, but for old times sake I decided to give it another try after hearing it had been renovated and changed management. This was a mistake. 

Upon our arrival, around 5:00 p.m. , we weren't greeted. There was no hostess but there was a manager on a personal phone call, who upon seeing us didn't end the call promptly. We stood there for a few minutes waiting until she finally ended the call saying she'd call the person back later. As we entered the dining room, we notice that it was almost deserted, which should have been yet another warning flag. Don't ignore warning flags people, it won't end well. We were seated and told that the server would be along for the drink order and to help ourselves to the buffet. 

As we entered the buffet area, I noticed that they had removed an entire section of buffet. This would limit available options quite a bit. I grabbed some dry ribs, perogies, mashed potatoes and broccoli salad. I then went to the ""carvery"" where I waited for 5+ minutes for someone to notice me standing there. Not a single staff member noticed, or cared. I began to wonder if I was supposed to carve the meat myself, but decided against it. If someone hungrier than me decided to carve and hurt themselves, this place would be dealing with a lawsuit. I ended up returning to my seat with no meat from the station.  On the way by, I noticed that the chocolate fountain was barely operational and had a bunch of stuff floating in it. Not to mention the bananas were brown and the pineapple was dried out and also brown. I wasn't impressed but I decided to try to enjoy my meal. 

The first bite I took was of mashed potatoes, and they were instant. Instant potatoes on a buffet that costs $26.95 per adult for dinner! The dry ribs were evidently previously frozen and from a box. The perogies were small and chewy and had sat in the warmer for far too long. In fact, the only good thing on my plate was the broccoli salad, which I could make at home...and it still would've been better. That's when my partner pointed out to me that her chicken was raw. She also told me that the ginger beef was dry and impossible to chew. I called my server over immediately and there seemed to be a language barrier. She didn't seem to understand the severity of the raw chicken. Nevertheless she took the plate to her manager, who didn't even bother to come to our table. Though, she did get the chicken removed from the buffet.

With my partner no longer wanting to eat, I waited for a few minutes for either our server or the manager to return with an apology. Nobody came so I sought out the manager myself. I stated the problems with the meal: raw chicken, instant potatoes, disgusting food, no employee at the carvery, and finally the broken chocolate fountain. Her first response was, you're paying for your meal. I'll give you a discount but that's it. I was a little put off, as I had asked her what she could do for us. I stated that we had consumed less than a full plate of food combined and had no interest in consuming anymore. She again refused to give any more that 15% off and I told her that was unacceptable. I asked for her general manager's number and she claimed to be the GM. I then asked for the head office number, which she gave me. I stated that I would be calling head office and I wanted her to remove at least one person from the bill, given the situation. Eventually she did, but not without a fair amount of attitude and ridiculous statements like ""so what we serve instant potatoes,"" ""the chocolate fountain just broke this morning,"" ""please tell head office I had the chicken removed from the buffet,"" ""I didn't feel the need to come speak with you,"" and ""you came in here looking to cause trouble."" To say that I was insulted by her handling of the situation is an understatement. Honestly, our meal should've been free. It's a wonder to me that this place is still operational.

This place is dangerous. They do not prep or serve their food in accordance with health and safety standards. Their employees are unkempt and seem to have low morale. In fact we saw a chef outside smoking in his uniform and watched a male employee scratch himself and fill empty buffet stations without washing his hands. For $26.95 a plate, I'll eat somewhere I'm not at risk for food poisoning. DO NOT EAT HERE.",1

I went up to my room and was talking with a friend raving about the cheese cake and within a hour she said she was coming for a drink and a slice. One my 2nd visit that night we were served by Virgil.  He was the gentleman who cleared my plate and spoke to the Chef about the Cheesecake. We were torn between 2 cocktails and he helped us decide on the Passion Fruit Fizzie or something to that nature. Basically a baby bottle of sparkling wine and some liqueur that you self mix in a flute. It made two flutes so it made up for the $14 cost. We both ordered the Cheesecake, yes I had a 2nd peice, don't judge when you are Celiac you stock up on the good stuff. My friend who is not a Celiac kept asking if I was sure the cake was safe for me b/c she thought it tasted too good to be GF. Seriously reader go get the Cheesecake.

It came wrapped in a house made tortilla with stewed beans, cheese and pico de gallo. All the flavours complimented each other really well! I also love that they seared the burrito on the grill. This added a nice textural element to the dish and gave it a lightly charred flavour. I didn't care too much for the cucumber salad that came with the burrito though. I have to say, it was pretty tasteless. 

We also ordered the Queso Verde. Fried panko crusted Fontina cheese topped with salsa verde  How can you go wrong?? Crispy on the outside with a nice gooey centre. This is definitely a dish I would keep coming back for!

Overall, we really enjoyed our lunch! Great recommendation!",4

We arrived before 5 pm on a weeknight and there were already a few people there.  The food looked freshly made, there were two soups...hot n sour and of course wonton.  The wonton was the usual, there was fried rice, chow mein, shanghai noodle and singapore rice noodles but there wasn't lots of meat with these.  For meat there was sweet and sour pork, lemon chicken, ginger beef, chinese style bbq chicken, pork dumplings, spring rolls, breaded fish, chicken balls and breaded shrimp. There was salad but who really eats salad with chinese food?  Dessert choices were different flavour jello, cake and fruit.  I was hoping for the warm soup type dessert like the red bean or black sesame.

All this was only $16.95, better than the other western chinese buffets.  The waitresses came by frequently to clear plates and refill drinks.  I would recommend this place when you are starving for chinese food!",3

The chicken shawarma was tasty with moist pieces of chicken and a balanced sauce, but unfortunately could not top by ""best shawarma"" contender (Sunbake Pita). I would have liked it better if had some picked veggies and a more garlicky sauce. 

HOWEVER, their falafel has taken the ""best falafel"" spot in my heart... and stomach. Their falafel balls have a delicious crunch and flavour to them.

Street parking is free on Sundays but harder to find. I've been here twice. It's clean, brightly lit, simple & modern inside. They do have high chairs available, but no change tables and there is a larger table in the back that is better suited to group seating as a lot of the tables look more suited for solo/ couples seating. Unlike the other bingsoo places I've been to, there's no fake ones on display, except for the maple waffle; but they do have the metal cups & take out cups to demonstrate sizing. There are cheesecake slices on display which is actual edible product...I strongly recommend avoiding those. They are pretty hard/ stale, I'm not actually sure if those are made in-house either. Actually, I'd also say hard pass on the green tea bingsoo here and to eat-in rather than takeout...they package all of the bingsoo in a plastic container with a thermal wrapper which is not ideal because it doesn't help insulate the bingsoo; I had a messy puddle in 15 min. Other places pack the shaved ice in styrofoam, and separately pack whipped cream & ice cream topping in a separate container to prevent quick melting of bingsoo. The green tea was heavy on matcha powder dusting which is a little too bitter and the cookie/ brownie pieces were hard as rock. 
That being said; they have a robust selection of other bingsoo flavours and cafe treats. I tried the fresh fruit watermelon bingsoo which can only be ordered as dine-in, and I find that to be cheaper than some places offering the same thing. That was well worth it in presentation and portion size & I recommend sharing that with at least 2 people. Taste wise, it's a hit in my books. They also bring out extra dishes for sharing plus kid cutlery if needed... and they give you soft chewy gummy bears on the side. I'd also highly recommend the honey butter bread. It's the size of 1/3 a loaf of bread, super soft and fluffy milk bread with just the right amount of sweetness to balance it out, well worth its price. I'm glad I have this place another go cuz I do see myself returning for dine-in fresh fruit bingsoo, and for that honey butter bread, potentially that stuffed maple waffle too (it's pretty huge). It does help that the staff are friendly & attentive too.",4

Now it must be said that it was not my first time going to Chianti's. I actually celebrate my birthday with a large group of friends every year at Chianti's and I've never been disappointed. 

Anywho, we lucked out and our timing was perfect. The line behind us grew quite long, but we were seated almost right away. 

This is quite possibly the most perfect restaurant to visit while enjoying the fringe. There are ""vintage"" posters all over the restaurant advertising past fringe festivals. 

The prices are so reasonable here. I love that they offer all their pastas in a half portion for only $7! I know!! Only $7!? And I usually still have to ask to have it packed up. 

They serve hot, fresh bread with butter minutes after you order. They are so delicious, I find myself asking for another basket.

You can order drinks by the pitcher. Yes I do want a pitcher of bellini! =)

Then you see their pasta. It is made in-house and the noodles are thick and taste nothing like the pasta you boil at home. The sauces are rich and flavorful, I have yet to try one I didn't enjoy. I had ordered the fettuccine supremo. It has salmon and scallops in a creamy curry sauce. The curry was outstanding. I was always nervous to order this dish because I was worried that the curry would be too strong and I wouldn't enjoy it but it was divine! I highly recommend it!

You may find yourself too full from your main course here at Chianti's, but I know better. I always save room for desert! The tiramisu is delicious and I ordered it every time until on my birthday they brought out cake for me. It was their baileys cheesecake. It is literally the reason I go to this restaurant now. It is melt in your mouth, rich, addictive cheesecake. Do not miss out on this!

Now if you are still looking for reasons to stop in and visit this restaurant, I will give you only one more: on mondays and tuesdays, all their pasta creations are $9. Full size servings of authentic italian pastas for $9!?

All I can say is, watch out Olive Garden!

We were informed by our server when we paid for our bill that they were short staff as most staff don't roll in till about 4pm. Tsk tsk there's the problem.

I do have to say that Earls has done a great job decorating their patio and solarium. Very inviting. The decor was tasteful and comfy chairs. Lots of seating!

We ordered their drink specials that were $2 off and it included the Tiki Torch made with 
appleton white and vx rums, falernum, guava, orange and fresh lime. This drink was amazing and can be really dangerous if you are not too careful. I decided on their Baja Fish Tacos and it was supposed to be two corn tortillas with crispy battered cod, jalapeno pineapple salsa, cabbage slaw, avocado crema. Well very little avocado to be found and the cod was minimal (more battered than cod). This was too bad as I have had their tacos before and I was usually pleased with it.",3

I have gone once only to brunch and I really wanted to try their dinner menu.  I went on Tuesday where you can buy a fixed priced menu for 35.00....best bang for your buck! Seriously, unless you are super picky, this is a must try. The portions are huge, the food is amazing, and the staff are wonderful.  The restaurant itself has an open air concept...it is humming with excitement as the servers rush around with their orders. However, it is echo-y so this is not the place for a romantic date. The servers are friendly and professional and know their menu. I went with a friend, and our choice was easy...the set menu for $35.00. What was nice was that we started with a free appetizer...which was artic char with capers. Really fresh and delicious. We had the ""market salad', which was way more impressive than it sounds...a bowl full of veggie goodness - heirloom tomatoes, butter lettuce, hard boiled eggs and beans in a light but flavourful dressing....so good! Next was cod fritters with tartar sauce. This also was very tasty...soft cod in the middle and a crispy coating and a creamy zippy sauce for dipping.  Then we had a perfectly cooked roast chicken with an oat risotto and fiddle heads. I love how simple the menu is but how complex the flavours are. I was also impressed with the portion sizes...really large considering the quality of the food presented. Finally to finish off we had the Duchess Fraiser cake-  a light but flavourful chiffon cake with strawberry compote with a hint of lime. I am not a huge dessert fan, but after that meal I could have eaten two....what a perfect ending for a memorable meal. My only slight criticism is that I would like to see a bit more affordable beer and wine selection. I settled on a Trouble Monk beer because it made the most financial sense, but a house red and white wine that is decent would be appreciated.

Usually, when we go, we order lots of vegetarian appetizers and leave satisfied.  Their hummus is great, as is their baba ganoush.  I also enjoy their falafel, though it has at times been a little too dry for my preference.  I adore the haloumi cheese.  And the tzatziki is quite yummy.  Their Greek Salad is not an authentic Greek salad as it contains lettuce, something you'd never see in Greece, along with balsamic vinaigrette.  Still, it's a very tasty salad with fresh ingredients.

This past week, even though it's not been too cold, I met a friend there for lunch.  We split the combo appetizer platter and a ""Greek"" salad.  It was more than enough food for both of us, but we left very satisfied.  Oh, their dolmades are wonderful!

The one problem I have with Co Co Di is that they don't have a lunch menu, and their entrees are rather pricey for lunch.  Even sharing an appetizer combo can get expensive.

Co Co Di also offer non-Mediterranean dishes, but I have never tried them since I usually go there for Mediterranean food.

On Friday and Saturday nights, they also have belly dancers.  Don't worry, they won't pull you up and make you dance, unless you want to.",4

As for the food, it is very tasty. I enjoyed the different desserts and items I have ordered and the quality is consistent.

Venezuelan Chicken and Avocado on Naan: super scrumptious. I loved the flavour of the chicken and I thought it was nicely cooked. The Naan paired very well with the dish as a whole and the avocado tasted fresh.

Honey Almond Cheesecake: a bit pricey but I really enjoyed this dessert. The cheesecake was quite light and also rich in terms of flavour. I liked the level of sweetness and it paired really nicely with the almonds.

Blueberry Cheesecake: again, a bit on the pricey-end in terms of portioning. Personally, I was not a big fan of this one. The spread on top was gelatinous and did not taste very good. Honestly, it spoiled the whole dessert for me.

Signature Hot Cacao: super good beverage! I really enjoy their hot chocolate here. I find that it's very good and satisfying. You really taste the chocolate!

Matcha Latte: this drink is really nice. In terms of flavour, I really liked the strong matcha notes with the little bit of minty hit on the side. Very creamy and rich.

Sweet Vanilla Cold Brew: I personally enjoy their cold brew here. The vanilla flavour is really nice and pronounced. It pairs really nice with the cream. I find that it's an excellent cold beverage.",4

Small portions, looked NOTHING like the photos.

WAY over-priced for the tiny, bland, unspectacular portions.

Taste was average, nothing special. Even the garlic shrimp were bland and small, didn't even taste like garlic.

Lobster was chewy.

Waited over an hour to be seated, then another hour before our food arrived.

Huge chunk of greasy dust fell from air vent on the ceiling onto the table. I would have refused to pay if it would have landed in my food.

Tables were crammed in every possible space. I've never been in a more crowded restaurant. Several times staff ran into my elbow as I ate because there was that little space between tables. 

The noise level was extreme. Could barely hear each other speak. 

Overall, there was nothing about this experience that would make any of us want to go back. And it was our first time at Red Lobster. Very disappointed in our first impression. $200 for six people for that quality is ridiculous. Could have had a better meal at a regular family restaurant for less money.",1

We were greeted by a very friendly young lady who definitely spoke Portuguese.  She started off by explaining how to order and what is on offer. True to the culture there were many kinds of coffees available but I preferred just a regular brewed. The coffee was good and it came with free refills which I sure appreciated.  They offer a variety of sandwiches including vegetarian. They are all made with a unique cheese bun which is very light and can be eaten on its own.  I ordered the brisket sandwich and a chicken coxinha (don't ask me to pronounce it).  The brisket was tender and delicious but the bun fell apart and some oil or dressing leaked out so it was messy to eat.  It wouldn't be ideal for a formal setting but then again this isn't a formal place.  I really enjoyed the chicken coxinha and my wife said it was the best part of the meal. There is good WiFi and a touch free washroom.  As a bonus the table next to us had a birthday so we got to hear the two staff sing happy birthday in Portuguese!  I enjoyed having lunch here other than the messy sandwiches (I don't like sticky fingers). I can easily recommend A Bite of Brazil for breakfast or lunch and certainly in between for a snack. It's just north of Jasper Ave on 104th Street in the building where Sobeys used to be.,4

The Moxie's at West Edmonton Mall is just like any other Moxie's: dim lighting, loud music, young servers dressed entirely in black, a bustling bar, etc. This location is obviously a popular site for shoppers to stop after a long day of browsing so, at times, the actual atmosphere of the restaurant is irrelevant -- people will enter in whatever they are wearing, with whatever they are carrying. 

Each time I have gone to this location (including my most recent visit), the greeting at the door is fairly sub-standard. Little charm, all business to sit you down as quickly as possible. I never choose a spot on the ""patio"" because of the noise of Bourbon Street, which sometimes seems louder than the music they are playing inside. On my most recent visit, my server was very good. She was highly attentive and willing (and ready) to answer questions --  a high improvement over the hostess who had zero menu knowledge. However, one thing I noticed was the  MASSIVE amounts of staff they had on shift. They were literally swarming the service stations/POS areas. At any point and time, I could usually count 6-8 staff simply standing around in different areas. It looked terrible. 

Cuisine was typical chain grill affair. Their steaks are generally done fairly well. I ordered the steak sandwich last time I was there and it was done as I asked, but the way it was plated made it look like an extremely small portion compared to a mess of fries and sauces simply thrown on the plate. Whether you are a super high end place or not, you should always pay a bit of attention to the way you plate a meal. I also ordered the Moxie's peppercorn sauce for the first time and was extremely disappointed: it was very overwhelming while having an unpleasant taste. Avoid the extra dollar spent and just enjoy the already seasoned steak. 

All in all, Moxie's is your typical safe bet chain restaurant, including this location.",3

The wings weren't really what I had expected for being Thai. They tasted more soya sauce than anything. After a few minutes of being finished with the wings they brought our entree. Well, I had ordered the quinoa and avocado bowl with garlic  chicken. When I got my food there was no chicken included. I had to sit and wait for about 5-8 minutes before our waitress showed up to ask how everything was and if it's what we ordered. When she brought my chicken it was not garlic at all. Then when we were finished we waited another 10 minutes before they took our plates and we asked for our bill. After the bill was brought it took another 15 minutes for a manager to bring us the debit machine. It was after she saw our 6 month old getting crabby and us looking uncomfortable.

I had a late night noodle craving and unfortunately in my highly caucasian, highly senior-dense older Edmonton neighbourhood, it's slim pickings for any so-called ""ethnic"" food, even Westernized versions thereof.

So I took a chance on the New China and was pretty happy with what arrived on the doorstep. Nevermind that the lady said ""40 minutes"" and it showed up in 20 (yes!) and was 100% as requested and advertised, the food was not bad at all. And as an MSG sensitive person, I did not get that yucky headachy feeling from eating the food, and neither did it have that suspiciously glossy gooey look that is often a telltale sign of MSG use. 

The meat was not fatty or over-breaded, and the noodles (Shanghai and Singapore) had flavour and a decent mix of meat and veg. The Singapore vermicelli could have used more spice, but I'm sure one could ask.

I really love that the ""dinner for # people"" offers a larger variety of items from which to choose, versus the usual ""fried battered option A or fried battered option B"" which is more typical for set dinner options. It's a good deal ($35 for 4 items for 2 people), and I like that the dinner for 2 comes with smaller sized containers, so there isn't pounds of leftovers jamming up the fridge. And, despite it being ""small"", the container size was quite generous I thought; I'd hate to see the ""large"" containers.  There was enough food to last 2 adults 3 full meals.

I'd order from here again, which really says something, because normally I find western-style Chinese restaurant food pretty repulsive.

TL;DR: good food for a good price, not swimming in MSG. Avoid the Red Diamond Disaster house and order from New China!",4

My wife and I went to the harvest room for a date night dinner. They were offering a 3 course meal price fixed at $59 per person which included any appetizer, and entree and any desert. I think the price of my meal would have been over $100 without the deal, so we were off to a good start.
I started my meal with the foie gras and duck plate. It was amazing. I'm always blown away by ingredients that I myself have never cooked before.
In between the starter and main, chef Jost sent out an extra course of scallops and pork belly. The scallop was the best I've ever had. The pork belly cube was really cool because I've never had pork belly that wasn't made into bacon.
My main was problematic, not because it wasn't amazing but more because we had already eaten bread and 2 courses. I barely
Made it through my beef tenderloin. It was one of the most generous 8 oz cuts of meat I have ever seen. The meat was cooked perfectly and had an amazing red sauce on it, I don't know what it was and didn't think to ask.
For desert I had the maple cheesecake. Surprisingly the highlight of this was the shards of sesame sugar embedded in the cake. The whole thing came together perfectly.

Some fantastic appetizers to order is the Sampler Italiano that you can create, the Brushett ($7.75), the Hot Artichoke-Spinach Dip ($8.50 too good for words), the Lasagna Fritta ($9.25), the Smoked Mozzarella Fonduta ($8.95), the Stuffed Mushrooms ($7.75) and best of all the Calamari ($9.50).  There are some days were all we order are appetizers and just stuff ourselves on that.  But when we do order the main dish we usually order the Fettuccine Alferdo, the Five Cheese Ziti al Forno (which is baked), the Cheese Ravioli (with marinara or meat sauce), the Chicken and Shrimp Carbonara is really good.  If you manage to save room for dessert I would suggest the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake or the Lemon Cream Cake, my brother your recommend the Tiramisu.

The service is really great; they don't seem to get mad at us for staying there for like three hours on a busy night.  That's another thing, the place is busy as busy can be so if you can make a reservation (I'm not sure they will let you make reservations on the weekends).

It's funny how preconceived notions can be. For some reason I was picturing a little hole-in-the-wall type of restaurant cramped with dingy lighting. This is the complete opposite of the actual restaurant. Sure on the outside it doesn't seem like anything special. But in side the space is large, open, spacious, colourful and cheerful. It is a very inviting atmosphere. 

Padmanadi is 100% vegan, but the owners seem to know that many carnivorous people are not going to be convinced to order kale and tofu dishes. Instead they creatively make dishes using 'meat' like ginger beef, BBQ pork and sweet & sour chicken. Don't be afraid that your meal will be a bland piece of tofu and rice, because it won't. I ordered an lychee drink, which was delicious and creamy, maybe they used soy milk.  I then ordered the mushroom chicken, which had a variety of mushrooms and soy chicken. Now here's the thing some people will tell you that you won't be able to tell the difference between this and eating actual chicken. Well that's not true. I could tell I wasn't eating real chicken, it didn't taste quite the same. But the texture was very close, and it's not like this was a bad taste - the whole meal was delicious.

Prices were on par with other coffee shops, and the drink was served in a tall glass.

I saw their restaurant lit up from outside and was intrigued by the beautiful interior. I thought it was a new restaurant, because they had no signage that could be seen from the street. 

My first experience at Cafe Mosaics was to just stop by for a drink. Their drink menu really caught my eye, I wanted to try everything, from their tea lattes to their tonics and elixirs. I remember walking into the cafe and being confused as to where to go. Do I just grab a seat like at a coffee shop? Then order at the counter? Or is there table service. It wasn't very clear based on the layout of the cafe. We eventually figured out when a waitress came to take our order. 

I recently stopped by Cafe Mosaics again to have dinner with a friend. She's vegan and loves this restaurant so I was willing to give it another try. I was really excited to try their Against All Grain Benny for $16 and a tea latte. 

Our food came first, and shortly after our lattes arrived. I thought this was weird as drinks usually come first. 

All in all my food was only okay.  The vegan hollandaise was cold, while my eggs and shredded mash were warm. Is the hollandaise supposed to be cold? It doesn't make any sense served on top of a warm dish. My friend also kept commenting on how small my food portion looked. 

In addition to the food being medicore. I was surprised to see that this restaurant didn't accept credit cards. I felt like I went back in time a few decades. 

I wish that I could give Cafe Mosaics a better review as Edmonton desperately needs more plant based restaurants. Sadly, this one just doesn't hit the mark for me.

Never has a restaurant been so needed.

Black Pearl Seafood Bar is the first independent, dedicated seafood restaurant to open in Edmonton in decades. It takes the pretentiousness out of seafood, has a magnificent but friendly high-seas decor and is run by a family who are not only born restaurateurs but treat all customers as family.

Oh yes. Seafood lovers, rejoice. They also make fabulous, delicious, exquisite seafood.

This column has great appreciation and respect for the Crudo family - brothers Nick and Cristo, father Giuseppe and now Nick and Cristo's wives plus a few front-of-house cousins to boot. Nick and Cristo grew up in restaurant kitchens as Giuseppe - Captain Jack as he's currently being called -- had Galileo's in Old Strathcona, then Nicola's and Scampi's in Pendicton.

The family moved back to Edmonton when mom came down with cancer. After she passed away, to keep Giuseppe busy, they opened Cafe Amore off 118 Avenue in 2011. The rest is history. Café Amore was so successful that customer demand forced the Crudos to re-locate into a larger space at 106 Avenue and 108 Street north of the downtown.

Black Pearl is the realization of another family dream, to open a small, top-quality but casual seafood restaurant. ""We all love seafood,"" says Cristo.

Nick spent weeks on the East Coast to find the right seafood broker to buy the clams, crabs and lobsters right off the fishing boats and ship them by air to Edmonton within hours. The former Lit space on trendy 104 Street has been transformed into a seaside café complete with weathered barn boards, netting and ocean photographs. You can practically smell the salt in the air.

The food is even better than was imagined. The menu is ""alive"" and constantly changing according to what has arrived from Nova Scotia or the west coast.

For now, Black Pearl is focused on shell fish. For the quality and the generous portions, prices are reasonable, an average $20 to $25 per dish.

Earlier on the day of our visit, Nick had been to the airport to pick up a shipment of fresh clams, hence the special of the day claim in a tomato sauce with sliced, home-made, salty-sweet Italian 'nduja sausage. It was superb, and I do mean superb.

Dining Black Pearl style means coming as a group, ordering a bunch of dishes, sharing all around, using Black Pearl's special shell-cutting utensils with plenty of napkins.

Everything was so fresh, bursting with ocean flavour, and, of course, perfectly cooked.

If you're an oyster fan, nothing rivals the fresh, slippery coolness of the Black Pearl oysters, even if they cost $3 each. Two oyster skeptics in our party were converted that night into oyster lovers.

There's not a mac and cheese in town to rival the Black Pearl's, filled with fresh, shelled lobster meat that had been moving around the tank a half-hour before. Ditto for the crab, still in the shell, but chopped up into a beautiful, Thai-like gently spiced cream sauce (chili, scallions, ginger).

The heat had deliberately seared half the light batter off the fresh squid rings cooked in a hot wok, creating a unique half/half dish of breaded and unbreaded fried squid, a luscious mix of crunch and soft in the mouth.

The carpaccio had its own twist - the ground sirloin being as fresh as fresh can be, delightfully spiced and balanced with bitter arugula salad leaves and shaved parmesan cheese.

We were like kids in a seafood candy store. ""Don't come here to Black Pearl on a first date,"" advises grown-up daughter Liza. ""Put your hair up, don't wear your best clothes."" (Seafood does tend to be delightfully messy.) ""Prepare for great food, a great sharing experience and a ton of fun.""

(Due to holidays, The Weekly Dish will shut down for a few weeks, resuming May 26 online, May 27 in the Sun's print edition.)",5

The amount of money spent on this spot boggles the mind. When you walk in the hotel there is a giant open lobby bar, and the two new Bonacini restaurants Kindred on your left and Braven on the right. The decor smacks of modern sophistication from the lighting to the tables and chair. Just outstanding. 

The restaurant itself is elegance turned up to 11. We get our table and go to work.

The GF decided on a three course set option consisting of a cream of mushroom soup which as good as anywhere on the planet. Rich and thick topped with creme fraiche. Next a grilled salmon with tomato compote and a thick sticky toffee dessert. She loved every bite..

I went ala carte starting with the best fried squid I've ever had. Deep fried in a tempura like batter with a XO mayo for dipping. I can't emphasize just how perfect these little bites were. Amazing. Followed up that gem with a expertly cooked 12oz NY strip with grilled rapini and a creamed peppercorn and cognac sauce. Honestly just heaven on a plate. I probably wouldn't do the rapini again just a little too bitter and over charred for my palate, but no problem. Wrapped the whole thing up with a decadent cheesecake wrapped in philo and baked to a delightful golden brown. Top that baby with blueberries and you have a near perfect end to a meal. 

The service was absolutely top notch, our server Chrissy was incredible. For a place only opened for two days, she was really knowledgeable with the menu and super friendly. We had no less than 3 managers stop by our table and introduced themselves and make sure we had everything we needed. One of them, Ashley, even contacted another Bonacini restaurant in Toronto where we will be next week and told them to take good care of us. Certainly not a typical or expected touch you get at most places. We even got a couple glasses of Prosecco on the house when we first sat down. Above and beyond...

You can expect to pay a lot or a little depending on how much of an experience you want to tackle. Their wines go from 60-1000 dollars. The list itself is a mix of old favourites and some new offerings. You can dine on the economically efficient side if you'd like or full blown extravaganza. 

I don't toss out 5's very often, but this place deserves a 6 probably. Can't wait to go back, you should absolutely get there for a meal as soon as possible

Cheers 

Andy",5

Tasty Tomato brings that homey feel with a twist - delicious!!

I started with the Tri Colore salad on special.  It was a bed of mixed greens, with grape tomatoes and Bocconcini cheese on top, with vinaigrette dressing.  Everything tasted great and fresh, but I wish there was more cheese (there was only 2-3 little pieces) included.

For my entree, I had the Lobster Medallions with Rose sauce (on special).  The pasta was well-cooked and lobster wasn't overdone, but the Rose sauce was the standout!  It was tangy, creamy, with the perfect amount of spice to give it a little kick.  It was decently sized for a full meal, or can be shared (with an appetizer) for a light meal.

Located on the east side of the tracks on Whyte, you'll easily pass their sign if you aren't looking specifically for it. However, it is definitely worth seeking out. I was shocked/impressed that they have an actual nice, quaint little patio outside to eat and people watch. This would definitely be an awesome little spot in the summer, reminds me of Montreal a little bit. Hidden gem indeeed (just look for Daawat and it is just a bit west of the Indian restaurant).

We went on an early Friday for dinner and there were only a couple people inside mulling around. One super easy going lady was working the whole restaurant (waitress, runner, chef) - impressive! Don't know how she does it when it gets busy but big props to her. They had some chill beats going on in the background, a little hippity hop, which I am always in approval of.

We decided to share:

- Buta belly ramen burger ($11.00) - if you've never had a ramen burger (my first time!), it's worth a try. The ramen is cooked so the noodles are soft and tender and stuffed with pork belly, arugula (more like mixed greens), green onions and a spicy Japanese mayo sauce. The sauce had just a hint of spice to it but gave the burger a nice kick to it. It was good but the amount of ramen noodles were a bit overwhelming for me. A bit too much gluten pour moi.
-  Vietnamese lemongrass pork ($15.00) - one of their special dishes for the evening. Came with a fried egg, cucumber and tomato garnish, spring rolls and jasmine rice. The spring rolls were dope! I don't usually brag about how good spring rolls are but these were perfectly crispy on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside. The jasmine rice was disappointing - you need to dump the fish sauce over it to give it any sort of taste. Overall, dish wasn't bad but wasn't impressive either. Should have tried the polish potato pancake with schnitzel!  Bah. 

The dish also came with choose between soup (borscht or miso) and salad (just a tossed salad according to our waitress). Easiest  choice - BORSCHT all the way. At a diner? Hell's yeah. The soup was flavourful and full of delicious beet(ness). Mix in the dollop of sour cream and you are golden.
- We ended our meal with a complimentary cookie from the chef. How sweet of her! Chocolate chip and chocolate chip with M&M - they were a bit hard but whatever, they were free.

Will have to come back to try out their Polish dishes! Perogies for sure next time. Dingy but interesting hole in the wall diner that is worth a try.",3

First, the ploughman jacket potato. I really only need to say ""cheddar bacon ale sauce drizzled over pulled pork""... But this is the one thing we would have gone bald for more of. The tastes were balanced, not overly salty, and the beer didn't over power the cheese. Apparently, the look on my face when I had my first bite was hilarious. 

We also tried the yorkies (I can't remember the name), and they were also good. I wasn't sure how having pickles and mushrooms in the meat was going to work, as I am a fan of neither, but I loved it. The chips on the side were a nice surprise, and I believe house made (although I could be wrong). We left the truck thinking, ""Where the heck were these guys when we were planning our wedding?!?"" They would have been part of the food for sure.

I'm going to start this off with 4 stars, but I think I need to come back to assess this place properly. I will say that the pizzas that I had are all excellent and I wouldn't hesitate in ordering them again. The pizza dough is made in house and it was backed perfectly. My favorite has to be the elk pizza with elk from a local(Morinville) farm but the shrimp and pineapple was a close second.

We had a choice between wine or beer. I'm a beer geek, I like the occasional wine, but given the choice between the two, it's almost always going to be the beer. Unless it's not good beer and I'm sorry, but their beer selection is horrible. They have about 15 taps and all but two of them are macros; stuff I would never touch. They have two local beers, Yellowhead (a lager) and Alley Kat's Aprikat (an apricot ale). It's great to have local beers, but these aren't a good choice. Alley Kat makes much better beers than Aprikat. So initially, I had an Aprikat and then I switched to the wine.

Wow. I loved the wines. Both were small lot Sandhill Estates wines, but my favorite was the Sangiovese small lot which was only 23 barrels. It was very dry, medium bodied, and full of tannins. I got a lot of cherry and fresh herb notes. It was quite spectacular.

Next up, I got my hands on some menus. The menu in this place is big, the dinner menu has 35 dishes which could be hard to provide consistency. I'm willing to give them a try though. There are things on the menu that sound exquisite, but most of them are on the appetizer section. I also am happy to see that their philosophy is ""farm to table"" and they have a list of local farms that they use.

The thing is though, that it can only go down unless they fix their beer selection. I think the rating is accurate given my experience here at the party, but I would like to try out more of the menu. The thing is though, that their rating can only go down unless they fix their beer selection. I cannot give a restaurant 5 stars if they carry such horrible beers, no matter how good the food is.",4

When it first opened up on Saskatchewan Drive, I was always itching to go there - it had some of the best Indian food I'd ever tasted. The atmosphere was thriving; the service was fantastic; and you finished your meal with a complimentary mango lassi.

Dining at the Manning Crossing location was nothing like I'd remembered it. At 6:30pm on a Wednesday evening, when the restaurant should have been packed, it was less than a quarter full. The mood was somber, and the server even more so. After leaving us at our table with the drink menu, he disappeared for 5-10 minutes and never bothered to bring us the a la carte menu, assuming that we'd want the buffet. The server finally arrived to take our drink order and, amidst our post-workout hunger pains, we just decided to head for the buffet.

I don't remember the buffet ever being this...bland. It had the usual options: steamed or saffron rice, a number of vegetarian dishes, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, a madras, naan bread, and poppadoms. We selected a bit of everything, including a mushroom do piyaza and a goat rogan josh. Most of the curries were mediocre, the goat rogan josh was horrible and consisted mostly of bones, and the butter chicken - while decent - wasn't nearly as good as others I've had.

We might as well have gone to the mall and paid $7 for exactly the same thing - that would have been the gist of this $20 a head all-you-can-eat disaster. And the worst part is, what with naan bread and rice, you really can't eat that much. Nor do you want to.

One other thing that really annoyed me: I like a little mood lighting, but it was too damn dark. Ambience is fine, but when you can't tell whether you're eating red or white meat, you need to light the place up a little bit.

With no complimentary mango lassi in sight, we decided to call it a day. The server never returned to check on us or drop off the bill, so we had to pay at the front as we left. This would be fine if a) the restaurant was stinking busy, or b) the rest of the dining experience had been a good one. Unfortunately, the restaurant was as dead as O-Ren, and I still had the taste of overcooked goat in my mouth.
Like I said, I'm sure a la carte would have been the better option. Judging by the number of tables in the restaurant and the percentage of people browsing the buffet, though, I have to wonder whether anyone actually orders from the menu anymore. That would explain the server's apparent surprise that I wanted to look at it - apparently people tend to favour instant gratification as opposed to flavour when it comes to Indian food in Edmonton.

As sustenance, the New Asian Village buffet will do. It'll fill you up, if that's what you're going for. Personally, I live to eat, rather than eat to live. I want my food to be memorable, with deliciously distinct flavours and aromas, rather than looking like something dished out over a mall counter - particularly Indian food, which traditionally has such aromatic spices and explosions of flavour and zestiness.

\For the sake of my past experiences, I would try this restaurant again. It deserves to be judged by its a la carte menu; although popular, a restaurant's buffet can never be a clear indication of the quality of the food. If you have a craving for authentic Indian food, take a chance on a la carte. If you're just looking to fill your guts, I'm guessing the buffet will suit you fine. You can always load up on butter chicken and naan bread...you'd fit right in with the handful of other diners skulking around the hot plates.",2

Our server was really quite attentive and seeing as we arrived before the dinner rush we were seated right away which was wonderful. I like the fact that one can change the soup or pasta option for the unlimited menu options for different servings (though I'll admit that my first pasta serving was too large and so I didn't get to try any others).

First, the location. Maybe it's the cheap rent, or the proximity to NAIT (students likes their ribs...?), but I find the location a bit of a turn off. It's located on a quiet  strip mall, by a comic book store and surrounded by constructions. The sign is maybe a little too humble.

Second, decor. Again, after reading the reviews, I was expecting a cute mix of cowboy/modern decor, but what I saw was poorly planned Ikea/cow skin galore.

Third, the food. The portions are MASSIVE! So, if you like to eat 3 lbs of overcooked, dry, tasteless meat on bones. This is the place to go. I had the ribs and I think they are under-marinated, and they are trying too hard to inject the ""Southern"" influence in the flavors, they don't mesh well together.

Utterly disappointed, maybe I should have expected less...or none at all.",2

It's not the type of liquor store that the drunks crawl to to buy their $5 dollar box of wine, nor is it frequented by the neighbourhood teenagers as a place to pick up their pre-drinking supplies before heading off to some trendy club that will be out of business next week.

Jennie M, in her review, already covered in great detail about Aligra's vast and diverse wine selection so I don't need to expand on that. They also have a fridge full of imported and domestic beers and ales with funny names like Skull Splitter and Vulcan Ale (Yes, it is named after Spock's home planet). The beers are sold in individual bottles so it's great for people that enjoy trying different brands of beer without having to purchase a whole case.

On that note, you won't find the usual brands of beer that you see advertised on TV commercials featuring moose, snow, and every other unfortunate Canadian stereotype that you can think of. This is strictly for people that want to try something different.

Their selections of all the other bar staples (whiskey, vodka, rum, etc) is excellent too. They have the exotic and the run-of-the-mill.

Aligra sells a selection of pre-packed gift baskets featuring all sorts of goodies and they will also custom-build baskets on request. On my last visit there they were also selling ""Grab 'n Go"" bags filled with 6 different wines selected by the staff for around a hundred bucks a bag.

They also have events once in a while such as wine tastings. Recently Erik Turner of the band Warrant (""Cherry Pie"", ""Heaven"" . . . remember them?) was there for an in-store appearance to promote Warrant's new brand of wine. Apparently it's required by law now for all classic rock bands to have their own line of booze products.

Aligra's staff are extremely knowledgeable on the product they're selling and are always happy to help you pick out what's right for you.

I don't know how all those reviewers can say this is a great place to eat. Let's be honest because we just spent a small fortune on lunch for 4 that was worse than Boston Pizza.

We arrived after the lunch crowd Wed & the hostess had her pretentious nose in the air. It took beyond forever. 40 minutes to get our food after we ordered in an empty dining room except for us & the hostess' family. The Margherita pizza was cold & congealed looking. My pesto pasta was swimming in its own pool of oil... The shrimp addition was done perfectly. The regular spaghetti with bison sauce was blah, had better says hubby. The other spaghetti with bison meatballs were disgusting...no sauce, old dried hard ping-pong ball sized meatballs.. the whole dish looked & tasted like day old fare. The waitress was put out that we were pointing out this...that we weren't ""sophisticated"" enough to know what meatballs & spaghetti are suppose to be like. The hostess had the tenacity to say that if we felt that this was not good enough, she'll ask the cook to remake the dish. Like night & day, the new dish actually had fresh meat, sauce & pasta. The most amazing thing was the new dish took 5 min!! So why did our food initially took 40 min in an empty dining room 2pm Wed afternoon???! Did I mention that the hostess & waitress were ghost throughout this ordeal!!!

Hopefully you can line up before noon as if you get there too late, the line up snakes down the sidewalk often to the corner of Jasper & 107 Street.

Today I got my favourite pork belly sandwich  with Drift fries. *smile*

Their food makes me happy! And you know what else makes me happy? Seeing Kara as pleasant and sweet as ever at the window! She is such a doll and the nicest food truck order taker in YEG. Was sad to see Nevin missing in action, but Kara informed me he was manning their brick & mortar store on 124 Street (Dovetail Delicatessan).

The wait wasn't too bad for the food, which came out hot and fresh. It's nice to see that they now take credit cards!

The bread was fresh and soft and the flavour of the meat was tasty. They had the shredded carrot and cucumber to complete the sandwich nicely.
Next came the soup which would have been nice to have with the sandwiches. The soup had many vegetables like broccoli, string beans and even cauliflower but was missing what I would consider the most important ingredient which is mushrooms.

Some staff come and others go, the main staff I think are constant-but the wait staff change like the drink specials. 

I have been here for late afternoon drinks or early evening dinners. They have a guest DJ playing on the second floor just on saturdays-but never seen or heard anything else about it. 

I have tried several snack dishes and now stick with the salads-the dry ribs and chicken wings don't have much meat on the bone. You can also get them to make up a veggie plate with a side dressing and I prefer that. 

I have also had the weekly taco special;  which is a small wrap with a LITTLE  lettuce/ground beef even though its cheap its not really tasty.  

The afternoon/evening drink specials are whats good here-the bartender last time I was there was still helpful and attentive. The house vodka is some cheap alberta product-spend the extra 1.50 and get an upgrade to Smirnoff. 

The weekly shrimp special is quite good value, but don't get the sauces on the shrimp, get it in the side for dipping-or get a powdered spice. I have tried the deep fried/baked mashed potatoes-and didn't like it so I usually stick with french fries. A lot of people seem to order hamburgers there. 

My favourite dish is the steak,  and great value at 10-12 bucks on the weekly special-maybe is Mondays. I have heard there weekly pizza special is really good value-but will stick  to the one dish that they can serve great all the time STEAK! 

I used to hang out on the patio in the summers when it was chili's food chain- but the first and only only time  I sat on the upstairs patio at O2's was this past summer-there was a medical emergency; one overly drunk guy slices his hand on a glass or something while sitting at the outdoor patio bar, and I have not been on the patio since-he bled out ALL OVER like a slaughtered cow-Bon appetite.",3

This diner-like burger joint is a fresh addition to north Edmonton. Upon looking at the menu, this was not cheapest burger place there is. Most burgers were about $6.50, with more specialty burgers ranging toward $8.

The service is pretty unique here. Once you place your order at the counter, they give a bright yellow sign, with your order number on it, to put on your table. Once your burgers are ready, the waitresses will bring it to your table, wherever you chose to seat yourself.

My boyfriend tried the Original Fatburger, which was not the best burger he's ever had. He said it was good, but not $6.50 good. I tried the Mushroom Swiss Burger, and we both decided that it was delicious! The patty was not the best that I've ever had (not super juicy, but that can mean leaner/healthier), but everything else inside made it awesome. They certainly don't go cheap on the mushrooms. There was enough to cover the entire patty and were generous slices. The cheese on it is what made the burger worth $8 for me. It was melted well and maintained it's soft texture, even after the burger cooled - definitely not processed Kraft slices.

Along with our burgers, we chose to share an Oreo shake. Their menu was bragging that they had the best ice cream shakes. When we first tried it...MY GOSH...it was the THICKEST shake we've ever had. It tasted amazing!! It was like a finely blended Oreo Mcflurry, made with lots of real ice cream and Oreos. I will definitely be back for their Mushroom Swiss Burger and their shakes!!

This place is a bear drinker's paradise.  72 draft beers! The barkeepers were enthusiast and knowledgeable. The beer, MM MMM M guuud. The atmosphere was easy going and relaxed. I wanted to eat light; more room for beer :)
Whenever I check out a new spot,  I like to keep it simple, and so ordered a Caesar salad. I've found a fresh salad means well kept veg. proper refrigeration etc.  Lettuce was crisp the dressing was authentic; also had a starter of chicken fingers, nice N tasty. Next trip I'll try some real food. I went for the beer :-D
Looking forward to trip #2",4

Kendra and I went to Ruth Chris, since it was right next door to our hotel.  I have been to the one in Calgary, so I already knew it was awesome.  But wow.... I forgot how awesome it was!

I was checking out teh other reviews, and honestly, I was totally surprised by the 1 - 3 star reviews.  I couldn't even give this place a 4 star, because it was a first-class experience.

I had the beef tenderloin and stuffed chicken combo, and the chicken practically melted in my mouth, it was so tender.  The beef followed suit.  It was so tender, I barely had to chew it.  The garlic mashed potatoes were to die for!

Looks like they had a bad run in October, 2011 with some reviewers, but be rest assured, in November they made a comeback!

They were definately pricey though!  For two women to have a meal, the tab came to $167.  Plus tip on top of that.  So, it was a $200 night.

A no frills kind of bakery and tiny interior with almost all the selection gone! I suggest going earlier than I did! Luckily there was still one bag of cheese buns left- I've been wanting to try these since I heard good reviews.
1/2 dozen cheese buns for $4.00. They are GOOD! Way better than the ones u can get from the grocery store, with tons of cheese on bottom surprisingly. 
I want to come back to try their donuts next time.",4

I have so much stuff from IKEA. The great thing about the place is you can have the cheap, bare-bone basics or you can spend a little more money to get something classier. They have a really good price and style range. It's still cookie cutter furniture, but the quality is in my opinion pretty darn good for the price. The furniture is easy to assemble and the instructions are surprisingly straightforward for just being pictures. After years of shopping at IKEA, instructions with words frustrate me!

Their kitchen stuff is pretty much the best. I have potato peelers that were dirt cheap and work better than the expensive brand-name ones. I bought a lemon juicer for a dollar there years ago and it is still my favorite. Basically, most of the kitchen stuff is very affordable and of top quality.

The store is also a great place to go for a cheap, fun date! Decent* food for next to nothing, including frozen yogurt cones for a dollar! It's fun to just walk around and play in the show rooms. It's easy to spend several hours here wandering around and looking at all of the pretty furniture and accessories, fantasizing about your dream home.

One drawback: the lineups are horrible!! And you can easily get suckered in to buying a boatload of tchotchkes because they display them in rows beside the isles and you're standing there for so darn long!

(P.S. One day, EKTORP chair, you will be mine.)

*Update (2015), I got sick off the breaded fish, so maybe not so decent.",5

Only had one bad experience when I was ordering $2.75 well high balls and got charged about $6.50 per drink. I got more than a few so at the end of the night I was stuck with a near $100 bill. I may have been a little too tipsy and paid for it all. When I looked at the bill the next day I realized I was massively overcharged. I even asked the waitress 2 drinks in if I had been ordering the $2.75 well high balls and she told me absolutely. So other than the fact I got over charged like $50 one night it's a pretty decent restaurant",2

From serving of the water to taking the orders to clearing the table and coffee/water refills in between, all were done so swift. Servings were big and just right for the price. If you are not that hungry, servings can be shared as it is really a big portion. Great food. Our eggs ben were yummy and the crepe and pancakes were soft and fluffy. Fruits were fresh too.",5

Decent sake, very nice. Okay food, though some people have told me they were unimpressed with the freshness of the tuna.
I, personally, thought the tuna was totally average.
I enjoy the octopus balls the most, and they have deals on Wednesday, that makes it very worth it. Otherwise, most of the food is too little food for too much money.

I enjoy the music, and the friendliness of the servers, even though service is super slow, especially considering they are very small and on weekdays often very empty. One server even just totally forgot to put in half my order.

I had a completely average time at this middle of the road place.",3
